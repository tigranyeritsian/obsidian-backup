Problems with our School System
1. Industrial age values: making new factory workers
2. Lack of autonomy: no freedom to manage your time
3. Inauthentic learning: memorization and exams
4. No room for passion and interest: general knowledge
5. How we learn
6. Lecturing

A new education system where specialized teaching starts as soon as in 3rd or 4th classes.
