Problems with our School System
1. Industrial age values: making new factory workers
2. Lack of autonomy: no freedom to manage your time
3. Inauthentic learning: memorization and exams
4. No room for passion and interest: general knowledge
5. How we learn
6. Lecturing

A new education system where specialized teaching starts as soon as in 3rd or 4th classes.


Modern schools rely on obsolete methods like standardized testing and rigid curricula, prioritizing memorization over essential life skills needed in today's fast-paced, technology-driven world.

**Missing Skills**
Schools fail to teach crucial skills vital for current and future success:

**Goal Setting**
Learning lacks engagement without clear objectives. Students need defined targets ("this is what we're learning, why it matters, and how to track progress") to stay motivated and avoid aimlessness.

**Embracing Failure**
Schools avoid teaching the value of failure. Success requires learning from mistakes, yet participation trophies and hollow praise shield students from essential growth opportunities.

**Critical Thinking**
Rooted in the Prussian model designed for factory obedience, schools suppress independent thought. Fostering critical thinking (questioning assumptions, evaluating evidence, analyzing perspectives) would combat media manipulation and societal issues.

**Financial Literacy**
Essential money management skills (budgeting, investing, credit, taxes) are rarely taught. Understanding taxes empowers civic engagement and improves quality of life.

**Personal History Connection**
History is taught as irrelevant dates. Learning history backwards (understanding how the present evolved from personal, local, and global pasts) makes it a meaningful narrative relevant to individual lives.

**Constructive Arguing**
Conflict resolution frameworks are absent. Students need skills to navigate disagreements respectfully, listen to opposing views, seek consensus, and engage productively, unlike current discourse.

**Entrepreneurial Mindset**
While not everyone needs to be an entrepreneur, teaching resourcefulness, opportunity recognition, and calculated risk-taking fosters self-reliance and adaptability beyond traditional paths.

**School's Temporary Nature**
Students lack perspective on school's limited role in their lifelong journey. Understanding that current social dynamics (friends, popularity, struggles) are temporary reduces anxiety and focuses on long-term growth.
