It's recommended to start with low prices or offer services for free to garner initial interest and get customers invested in the process.

#### Business Ideas
recycling business, get government contracts to clean the cities from waste, take that waste and recycle it into building materials and start building commercial and residential buildings 

create a REIT(real estate investment trust), get money by loans or by investors, buy some real estate, put a little money in it and sell or give it for rent 

distribution business, create warehouses for my other businesses and then distribute the goods to other businesses or create my own company to provide regular consumers with products that they need via food subscription services delivering the goods to their homes (supply company, import, export and food subscription boxes) 

agriculture business, create an agricultural business to grow crop, vegetables and other goods via government subsidies, breed animals, get high quality meat and run all these goods via distribution business 

handicraft business to export Armenian cultural works 

home cleaning business, buildings maintenance contracts 

street food stalls business



Identify the weakest point in the customer value chain, research customer attracting



research government contracts






### **1. Electronics and Technology**

**Smartphones**

- Batteries glued or soldered inside, making replacement nearly impossible.
    
- Software updates that make older models slower or incompatible with new apps.
    
- Proprietary chargers and ports (forcing upgrades when standards change).
    
- Limited spare part availability after only a few years.
    

**Laptops and Tablets**

- RAM, SSDs, and batteries soldered to the board.
    
- Thin cases that overheat easily and shorten component life.
    
- Discontinued support for drivers or operating systems.
    

**Printers**

- “End-of-life” chips that disable the printer after a fixed number of pages.
    
- Sensors that falsely detect low ink.
    
- Expensive cartridges that make repair less cost-effective than replacement.
    

**Headphones and Earbuds**

- Non-replaceable batteries in wireless models.
    
- Fragile cables that fray easily, no modular repair option.
    

**TVs and Monitors**

- Power boards with weak capacitors that fail after a few years.
    
- Smart TVs that stop receiving updates and lose app functionality.

### **2. Home Appliances**

**Washing Machines & Dishwashers**

- Sealed drums that prevent bearing replacement.
    
- Electronic boards sensitive to moisture and voltage surges.
    
- Short motor lifespans designed for a fixed number of cycles.
    

**Refrigerators**

- Compressors and seals designed for limited durability.
    
- Sensors and control boards failing earlier than mechanical parts.
    

**Vacuum Cleaners**

- Plastic parts that crack or deform.
    
- Proprietary filters or bags that become discontinued.
    

**Coffee Machines**

- Capsule counters that disable the machine after a certain number of uses.
    
- Non-repairable water pumps or heating elements.

### **3. Fashion and Consumer Goods**

**Clothing**

- Cheap fabrics and dyes that fade, tear, or lose shape quickly.
    
- Stitching designed to fail under moderate wear.
    

**Footwear**

- Glued soles that prevent repair or replacement.
    
- Thin synthetic materials instead of durable leather.
    

**Accessories**

- Jewelry with coatings that tarnish quickly.
    
- Watches with sealed batteries or non-repairable cases.
    

---

### **4. Automobiles**

- Plastic engine components that degrade from heat.
    
- Software locks that prevent third-party repairs (“right-to-repair” issue).
    
- Proprietary diagnostic tools available only to official service centers.
    
- Frequent redesigns making parts incompatible between model years.
    

---

### **5. Software and Digital Products**

- Operating systems ending support (forcing hardware upgrades).
    
- File formats that become obsolete (older software can’t open new files).
    
- Cloud services discontinuing old app versions.
    
- Smart devices that stop functioning once servers are shut down.
    

---

### **6. Everyday and Niche Products**

**Light Bulbs**

- Modern incandescent bulbs historically designed to burn out faster (the _Phoebus cartel_ case).
    
- Some LED bulbs use low-quality drivers that fail long before the diode itself.
    

**Toys and Gadgets**

- Plastic joints or battery covers designed to snap easily.
    
- Limited spare parts and discontinued batteries.
    

**Kitchen Tools**

- Non-replaceable blades in blenders or food processors.
    
- Short-life plastic gears in mixers.
    

---

### **7. Vehicles and Tools**

- **Power tools:** batteries incompatible across new generations.
    
- **Electric cars:** limited battery warranties, high replacement cost.
    
- **Navigation systems:** paid map updates; new models come with “free lifetime maps,” making old ones seem useless.









**Dynamic obsolescence** (also called **technological** or **functional obsolescence**) happens when a product becomes outdated **not because it breaks**, but because **newer models or technologies** make it less useful or compatible — even though the old product still works.

It’s common in fast-changing industries where innovation, connectivity, or software drive value.

---

### **Examples of Products with Dynamic Obsolescence**

#### **1. Smartphones and Tablets**

- Older devices lose compatibility with new operating systems or apps.
    
- 4G/5G transitions make older network chips obsolete.
    
- New camera or AI features make older phones feel “slow” or “incomplete.”
    

#### **2. Computers and Laptops**

- Outdated processors or RAM can’t run modern software efficiently.
    
- New versions of Windows/macOS drop support for older hardware.
    
- USB, HDMI, and charging standards change, making ports incompatible.
    

#### **3. Smart TVs and Streaming Devices**

- Old TVs lose access to Netflix, YouTube, or other apps when support ends.
    
- New models include HDR or AI upscaling — older ones lack these features.
    

#### **4. Cars and Electric Vehicles**

- Older models lack connectivity (Apple CarPlay, over-the-air updates).
    
- New safety or battery systems make older models less desirable.
    
- Navigation systems become outdated when maps stop updating.
    

#### **5. Game Consoles**

- New generations introduce better graphics and exclusive games.
    
- Online services for old consoles (like PlayStation Network or Xbox Live) shut down.
    

#### **6. Smart Home Devices**

- Devices stop working when manufacturer servers go offline.
    
- Old versions can’t connect with updated ecosystems (e.g., Matter, HomeKit).
    

#### **7. Software and Apps**

- New file formats or frameworks make old versions incompatible.
    
- Web browsers and design tools drop plugin support.
    
- Companies move to subscription models, deactivating perpetual licenses.
    

#### **8. Cameras and Photography Equipment**

- New sensor technologies and AI features make old models less competitive.
    
- Memory cards, lenses, or batteries phased out for newer standards.

### **How It Differs from Planned Obsolescence**

| Aspect      | Planned Obsolescence                   | Dynamic Obsolescence                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Cause**   | Deliberate design for shorter lifespan | Natural result of technological progress    |
| **Focus**   | Physical wear or design limits         | Functional or technological incompatibility |
| **Example** | Non-replaceable battery                | Software no longer supported                |
