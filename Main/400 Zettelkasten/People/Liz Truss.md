- **Early Life and Education** Liz Truss was born in Oxford in 1975. Her parents were left-wing, and she attended Roundhay School before studying Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Oxford University. While at Oxford, she was a member of the Liberal Democrat Youth and Students committee but later became a member of the Conservative Party.

- **Pre-Parliamentary Career** After graduating in 1996, she worked for Shell, became a chartered management accountant, and served as economic director of Cable and Wireless. She also became the deputy director of the right-wing think tank Reform.

- **Entry into Politics and Early Parliamentary Career**
    
    - She first ran as a Conservative candidate in Hemsworth in 2001 but was unsuccessful.
    - In 2009, she was selected as the Conservative candidate for Southwest Norfolk, a process that involved a scandal due to an affair with MP Mark Field.
    - She was elected as an MP in the 2010 general election, representing a safe Conservative seat.
    - As a backbencher, she co-authored "After the Coalition" (2011) and "Britannia Unchained" (2012), both advocating free-market principles. She also co-founded the Free Enterprise Group.

- **Ministerial Roles**
    
    - She served as Under Secretary of State for Education and then Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs by 2014.
    - In 2016, Theresa May appointed her as the first female Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice. During this time, she faced criticism for her handling of media attacks on High Court judges following a Brexit ruling.

- **Prime Ministership**
    
    - Following Boris Johnson's resignation in 2022, Liz Truss became Prime Minister after winning the Conservative Party leadership election.
    - Her tenure was marked by the "mini-budget" announced on September 23, 2022, which included £45 billion in unfunded tax cuts, largely benefiting the wealthy. This budget led to significant economic turmoil, including a slump in the pound and rising mortgage rates.
    - Facing immense pressure, she U-turned on some policies, fired Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, and ultimately resigned on October 20, 2022, after just 50 days in office, making her the shortest-serving and least popular Prime Minister in British history.

    - Despite her short time in office, she appointed 11 people to the House of Lords in her resignation honors list.
    - In September 2023, she launched her memoirs, "Ten Years to Save the West," which were widely criticized.
    - In February 2024, she co-launched "Popular Conservatism" (PopCon), a group aimed at promoting the benefits of Brexit.
    - In the 2024 general election, Liz Truss lost her seat in Southwest Norfolk, becoming the first former Prime Minister since 1935 to do so.


The video concludes by criticizing the political system that allowed her to rise to power, suggesting it favors "pedigree and schooling over integrity, expertise, and a commitment to public service."
