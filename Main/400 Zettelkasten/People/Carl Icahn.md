## Core Strategies

1. **Activist Investing (Shareholder Activism):**
    - Buys large stakes in underperforming companies.
    - Pushes for changes: new management, restructuring, cost-cutting, or asset sales.
    - Often uses aggressive tactics like proxy fights (rallying other shareholders against management).
        
2. **Corporate Raiding (1980s style):**
    - Acquired controlling stakes and forced companies to sell assets or repurchase shares at a premium.
    - Controversial but highly profitable.
        
3. **Contrarian Approach:**
    - Prefers companies the market dislikes or undervalues.
    - Enters when prices are low and exits after value is unlocked.
        
4. **Risk Control:**
    - Uses activist pressure to reduce downside risk.
    - Makes money whether through dividends, asset sales, or stock buybacks.
        
5. **Concentration & Patience:**
    - Focuses capital on fewer, high-conviction bets.
    - Sometimes holds positions for years until management caves.

## Famous Tips & Advice

- **“The worst thing you can do is invest in companies with bad management.”**  
    → Icahn believes management quality is the key to shareholder value.
    
- **Buy undervalued companies, but demand change.**  
    Passive investing in undervalued firms isn’t enough; force improvements.
    
- **Be independent and contrarian.**  
    Icahn often invests where Wall Street consensus is negative.
    
- **Know when to fight and when to walk away.**  
    He wins by leveraging pressure, but doesn’t always aim for control—sometimes just a stake is enough.
    
- **Risk vs. Reward Discipline:**  
    Icahn looks for asymmetry: limited downside, huge upside if management changes succeed.
    
- **Capital preservation matters:**  
    Despite his reputation for aggression, he avoids overly risky bets and often hedges against market downturns.
