Culture encompasses traditions, norms, and customs that create a "cage of norms," binding society but resisting change. Institutions are formal or informal rules (e.g., laws, conventions) organizing society and enabling political processes through deliberate compromise.  

**Separation of Culture and Institutions**  
Institutions can transcend their cultural origins (e.g., democracy from Athens exists globally despite Athenian culture's extinction). They are not mere cultural outputs but deliberate political constructs (e.g., Solon created democracy to counteract Athenian cultural stagnation).  

**Why the Difference Matters**  
Cultural norms are stagnant and constrain politics, while institutions enable change via debate and adaptation. Institutions are crucial for effective governance, as seen in Sweden’s successful 1967 road-switch policy—facilitated by planning and mutual interest, not cultural obedience.  

**Interplay Between Culture and Institutions**  
States can shape conventions (e.g., Vienna’s "Ride with Pride" promoting LGBT acceptance via public transport, or Bavaria’s crosses in schools reinforcing Catholic norms). Conflicts arise when informal rules clash with formal laws (e.g., Polish migrants using "prawo jazdy" to evade Irish fines).  

**Institutions, Trust, and Political Engagement**  
Institutions rely on trust to function (e.g., Swiss newspaper stands rely on informal trust). High-trust societies enable effective policy, while low trust (e.g., Greece’s debt crisis) stems from broken institutions. Institutions empower political action by providing frameworks for compromise and collective decision-making.
