**Corporate Oligarchic Takeover**  
Structures of democratic capitalism weakened since 1971 by corporate assault on popular movements (anti-war, feminist, ecological). Key events include Reagan breaking the air traffic controllers union, NAFTA, welfare reform, Glass-Steagall repeal, media consolidation, and defunding of public broadcasting. Result: Transformation into a system controlled by global speculators and corporate entities.

**Democratic Party Transformation**  
Democratic Party corrupted by corporate money under Tony Coelho and Clinton, pushing out genuine liberals (e.g., Ralph Nader). Replaced with "faux liberals" (Obama, Clinton) serving Wall Street, disenfranchising the white working class. Party justifies economic savagery through symbolic diversity while ignoring core issues like trade deals, de-industrialization, and opioid crises in "sacrifice zones" like Pine Ridge and Camden.

**Media Polarization and Censorship**  
Media landscape fractured into partisan silos (91% NYT/NPR readers support Democrats, 95% Fox viewers support Republicans). Shift from agenda-setting to commercial sensationalism ("Hate Inc." model). Algorithms suppress dissident voices, burying stories like Hunter Biden's laptop. Journalists intimidated, prioritizing career over truth.

**Rise of Christian Fascism**  
Biden's corporate elite appointments (e.g., Neera Tandon) signal continuity. Christian Right (81% Trump support) acculturates to capitalist imperialism. Federalist Society now controls the judiciary and Supreme Court, enabling potential Christian fascism. Trump's incompetence prevented a coup, but a competent fascist (e.g., Pompeo, Cotton) could seize power.

**Systemic Failure and Authoritarian Risk**  
Corporate money dictates policy, rendering politicians vulnerable if they challenge elites. Sanders' capitulation (avoiding independent run) missed a historical moment. Widespread despair fuels authoritarianism. Rorty's warning of a "Weimar-like" period where a "strong man" exploits elite failure. Potential erosion of social gains (racial progress, LGBTQ+ rights).

**Climate Crisis and Resistance**  
Climate requires mass civil disobedience (e.g., Extinction Wall Street protest), not elite appeals. War analogy fails; crisis is a "slow-motion tsunami." Authentic resistance demands solidarity with the oppressed, rejecting liberal class complicity. Prison work underscores systemic injustice.

**Final Thoughts**  
Resistance must center on relationships with the oppressed (e.g., George Floyd protests) to maintain credibility. Censorship will escalate as Biden's unpopular policies face pushback. Only unequivocal opposition to systemic oppression can prevent authoritarian collapse.
