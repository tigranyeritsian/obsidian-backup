## Structured Unaccountability in Modern Institutions
Dr. Janine Woodell, author of "Unaccountable," discusses how elite power brokers across philanthropy, governance, corporations, finance, and academia create a corrupt system. She coins the term "structured unaccountability" to describe organizational siloing where employees (e.g., bank staff) are trained only on limited checklists, making complex problems unsolvable for individuals. Digitalization accelerates this.

## Elite Influence and Information Asymmetry
"Elite influencers" connect dots across multiple affiliations (e.g., retired general on government boards advising defense companies). They operate unaccountably because the public lacks information about potential conflicts of interest. This is facilitated by branding and information control by those in power.

## Decline of Accountability Mechanisms
Traditional accountability (e.g., investigative journalists as "muckrakers") has collapsed. Declining journalist numbers (especially investigative) and their shift to PR firms weaken oversight. Siloed government contracting further blurs lines, diminishing accountable structures.

## Parallels with Dysfunction
Modern US institutions (banks, academia, government) share surface characteristics with the past but function drastically differently. Government work is heavily outsourced, creating networks of influence echoing post-communist Eastern Europe-esque ungoverned spaces.

## Erosion of Trust and Outsider Status
A global sense of "Outsiders" emerges, fueled by perceptions of a gamed system (e.g., anti-corruption protests, Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street). Degrading institutions weaken governance in a negative spiral. Rebuilding trust requires integrating outsiders and fostered empathy.

## Pathways to Reform
Solutions include integrating outsiders into institutions (like the NY Fed), fostering accountable leadership from within networks that understands diverse perspectives, and bridging societal silos through bringing disparate groups together. Sustainable action is needed from insiders recognizing the current model is untenable.
