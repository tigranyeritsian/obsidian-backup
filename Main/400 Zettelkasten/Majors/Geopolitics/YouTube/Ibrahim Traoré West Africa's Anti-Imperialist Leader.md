Revolutionary Context**  
Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta) gained independence from France in 1960 but endured decades of instability, military coups, and neo-colonial influence. Key figures include President Maurice Yaméogo (1960–1966), who established a one-party state, and Lieutenant-Colonel Sangoulé Lamizana (1966–1980), whose rule oscillated between military and civilian governance. Thomas Sankara emerged as a revolutionary leader in the 1970s–1980s, advocating self-reliance, anti-imperialism, and Pan-Africanism before being assassinated in a 1987 coup led by Blaise Compaoré. Compaoré’s 27-year rule reversed Sankara’s reforms, aligning with Western powers and the IMF until his ousting in 2014 during mass protests.  

**Ibrahim Traoré's Ascent**  
Born in 1988, Traoré joined the army in 2009. After frontline service against jihadists and in UN missions, he grew critical of corruption and military ineffectiveness. He supported the 2022 coup against President Kaboré, then led a second coup in September 2022 to oust junta leader Damiba, citing failures in combating insurgents. At 34, Traoré became Burkina Faso’s transitional president.  

**Domestic Policies**  
Traoré prioritized security, launching a civilian defense force to combat jihadists and vowing to "reconquer all territory." Economically, he pursued resource sovereignty: constructing a state-run gold refinery (2023) and suspending small-scale gold exports to curb smuggling. Symbolically, he retained his captain rank, rejected his salary, and promoted anti-corruption and austerity.  

**Foreign Policy Realignment**  
Traoré expelled French troops (2023), suspended French-backed media, and ended neo-colonial ties. He forged the Alliance of Sahel States (2024) with Mali and Niger to counter regional sanctions and ECOWAS pressure. He embraced Russian security partnerships, strengthened Pan-African solidarity, and normalized ties with China and Algeria while rejecting Western interference.  

**Western Opposition**  
Traoré’s defiance of France and the U.S., along with his anti-imperialist stance and gold policies, strained relations. Western powers reportedly backed assassination attempts (18+ cited), sparking continental protests in his support. His focus on self-determination and sovereignty positions him as a direct challenge to Western influence in Africa.
