Overview of ISIS

- The Islamic State, commonly known as ISIS, originated as a breakaway faction of al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), emerging amidst the turmoil of the Syrian civil war.
- In 2014, ISIS declared itself a caliphate under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, expanding its control across significant territories in Iraq and Syria.
- The rise of ISIS was characterized by extreme violence, including mass executions and beheadings, which were publicized to instill fear and attract recruits.
- ISIS utilized modern media strategies, producing high-quality propaganda to portray itself as a formidable military force, which was amplified by Western media coverage.
- Despite its initial perception as an unstoppable force, ISIS's territorial control was short-lived, leading to its eventual collapse under US-led coalition attacks by 2019.

Leadership of ISIS

- He was killed in a US special forces raid in October 2019, reportedly detonating an explosive device to avoid capture.
- Following Baghdadi's death, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi succeeded him, but his leadership was overshadowed by the group's decline due to military pressures.
- Muhammad al-Adnani served as the chief spokesperson and was instrumental in shaping ISIS's propaganda and military strategies until his death in 2016.
