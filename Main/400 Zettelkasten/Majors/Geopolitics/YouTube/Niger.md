## Historical Context

Niger has a long history with France, its former colonial ruler. Even after gaining independence in 1960, France has maintained a strong advisory role in Niger's government and military. A French military presence was re-established in 1979, and today, France, along with the U.S. and other EU forces, uses the Niamey Air Base 101 as a central operations hub.

## The "Belt of Rebellions"

Coups are becoming more common in West Africa, particularly in the Sahel region, which is now being called "the belt of rebellions." The recent coup in Niger, which follows similar events in Mali and Burkina Faso, could set off a chain reaction in other African nations where France has a military presence.

## Why Niger is Important

Niger is the seventh-largest producer of uranium in the world. This makes it a vital supplier for France and the European Union, especially as they try to reduce their reliance on Russia and Kazakhstan for uranium.

## International Reactions

**ECOWAS:** The Economic Community of West African States has imposed sanctions on the new military leaders in Niger, freezing their assets and halting all transactions. They gave the junta until August 6, 2023, to reinstate the overthrown president, Mohamed Bazoum, or face military intervention.  
**Russia:** While the Russian government has called for a return to constitutional order, the head of the Wagner private military company, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has voiced his support for the coup.

## Possible Outcomes

- **Deadline Extension:** ECOWAS might extend the deadline, citing progress in diplomatic talks, even though early mediation efforts have failed.
- **Transition Plan:** A compromise could be reached where the junta and ECOWAS agree on a timeline for returning to democratic rule, which would include releasing President Bazoum.
- **Military Intervention:** This is seen as a last resort. A military intervention in Niger would be much more complicated than past ECOWAS operations because of Niger's large size, Nigeria's own security problems, and the risk of the conflict spreading to other countries, as Mali and Burkina Faso have promised to support the coup leaders.
    

ECOWAS has already made plans for a military intervention, with Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Senegal, and Benin all willing to send troops. Although a peaceful resolution is preferred, ECOWAS is determined to show its strength after failing to stop a series of coups in the region.
