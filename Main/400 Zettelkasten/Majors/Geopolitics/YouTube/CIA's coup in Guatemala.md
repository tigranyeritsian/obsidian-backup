- **Guatemala's Situation Before the Coup**:
    
    - Guatemala was heavily influenced by the Boston-based United Fruit Company, which controlled significant parts of the economy through its banana plantations, railroads, and ports.
    - The company benefited from massive tax exemptions due to widespread corruption within the Guatemalan government.
    - Despite the company's success, 80% of Guatemalans lived below the poverty line, and over 70% were illiterate, with an average life expectancy of just 35 years.
        
- **President Árbenz's Reforms**:
    
    - President Árbenz came to power promising to modernize Guatemala and reduce foreign influence.
    - He aimed to address the imbalance of wealth by implementing land reform, proposing to buy unfarmed land from large landowners, including United Fruit, and redistribute it to farmers.
    - Árbenz offered United Fruit $1.2 million in compensation for their land, based on the company's own tax declarations, but the company, backed by the U.S. State Department, demanded $16 million.
        
- **U.S. Involvement and Propaganda**:
    
    - United Fruit launched a propaganda campaign, funding journalists to spread false stories in American newspapers about communism taking over Guatemala and land being stolen.
    - Major U.S. publications like The New York Times, Time magazine, and The Washington Post published articles claiming Guatemala was falling to communism.
    - CIA reports and State Department officials, many with ties to United Fruit, echoed these warnings, despite Árbenz not being a communist and the majority of his cabinet being anti-communist.
        
- **Operation PBSuccess**:
    
    - In late 1953, President Eisenhower, advised by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and CIA head Allan Dulles (both with personal ties to United Fruit), authorized the CIA to overthrow Árbenz.
    - The operation, named PBSuccess, involved arming and training a Guatemalan exile, Carlos Castillo Armas, with support from the dictators of Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic.
    - The CIA engaged in psychological warfare, spreading false reports, blocking weapon shipments, and cutting off foreign aid to destabilize Árbenz's government.
    - Guatemalan army officers began to defect due to the intense pressure and propaganda, leading to Árbenz's resignation on June 27, 1954.
        
- **Aftermath of the Coup**:
    
    - Ten days after the coup, Armas was made dictator, and the U.S. quickly recognized his government and provided foreign aid.
    - Armas outlawed over 500 trade unions and returned 1.5 million acres of land to United Fruit and other large landowners.
    - The coup led to 40 years of dictatorship, terror, and genocide in Guatemala, with an estimated 200,000 people dead by the end of the civil war in 1996.
    - In 1999, President Bill Clinton admitted that U.S. support for Guatemala's military regimes was wrong, but no compensation has been paid to victims' families, and the U.S. has never officially apologized for its role in the coup.
