Operation Synindor: India-Pakistan Military Confrontation**
**Bahalgam Attack Precursor**
India launched Operation Synindor in retaliation for a Pakistan-sponsored massacre in Bahalgam, killing 26 tourists, including a Navy officer and a former banker. Perpetrators infiltrated via PoK, attacked picnicking tourists, and escaped into dense forests after a 30-minute assault.

**India's Airstrike Execution**
India launched precision strikes at ~1:28 AM against nine high-value targets in Pakistan/PoK (Bajaur, Jaish HQ, Muridke, etc.) using Rafale jets.
*   **Phase 1 (Primary):** Rafales launched SCALP EG (Storm Shadow) cruise missiles from Ambala.
*   **Phase 2 (Tactical):** Rafales deployed Hammer bombs against LoC positions (e.g., Kotli, Poonch).
*   **Phase 3 (Depth):** Su-30s fired Brahmos missiles deep into Pakistan.
*   **Support:** Loyalist drones targeted mobile assets. Strikes lasted ~23 mins, causing explosions and power outages.

**Pakistan's Claimed Response**
Pakistan stated it shot down five Indian aircraft: three Rafales, one Su-30, one MiG-21, and one Israeli drone. Details were presented in a video.

**Storm Shadow (SCALP EG) Mechanism**
French-made, low-observable cruise missile launched from Rafale/Typhoon/MiG-29. Uses GPS/terrain-hugging flight initially, switching to infrared/terrain matching guidance for terminal approach. Designed to evade radar.

**Potential Escalation Scenario**
Pakistan might retaliate using JF-17 jets (due to F-16 restrictions) targeting Indian air bases and armor. Strategy: "strike hard, fast, seize territory" to leverage India's strength with speed. Possibility of tactical nuclear weapons loomed conflict. Both sides aimed to avoid nuclear war but full conventional conflict remained a risk.
