**Historical Context**
Burkina Faso, renamed by anti-imperialist leader Thomas Sankara, experienced a cycle of coups since independence. Sankara was assassinated in a France-backed coup in 1987, leading to decades of Compaoré's authoritarian rule aligned with Western interests. Recent coups include Damiba in 2022 and Traoré in September 2022, the latter accusing Damiba of failing the people and protecting foreign interests.

**Traoré's Rise**
Captain Ibrahim Traoré, born a year after Sankara's death, served as an artillery officer in the Sahel insurgency. Disillusioned by the failure of Western-backed security efforts, state collapse, and perceived neocolonial extraction, he led a counter-coup against Damiba. He positioned himself as Sankara's heir, citing patriotism and revolutionary ideals.

**Revolutionary Actions**
Within months, Traoré expelled French military forces (ending Operation Barkhane), terminated colonial-era military agreements, suspended French state media (RFI, France 24), and audited/scrutinized foreign mining contracts. He aims to reclaim national wealth, criticizing the "gold drain" under foreign control and promoting self-sufficiency in Sankara's vein.

**Information Warfare**
Western media portrayed Traoré negatively ("junta," "Putin proxy"). In response, Burkina Faso suspended/banned media outlets like BBC, VOA, Guardian, and HRW for "disinformation" and "destabilizing narratives," protecting state control over information amidst a battle for local and international perception.

**Geopolitical Impact**
Traoré's defiance inspires defiance across Africa and threatens Western economic dependency models. The US suspended Burkina Faso from regional bodies (ECOWAS) over its alliance with Mali and Niger (Alliance of Sahel States) focused on self-defense and expelling foreign forces. Public support remains strong, evidenced by large civilian volunteer enrollments. US accusations of gold diversion trigger counter-responses, reflecting heightened tensions.
