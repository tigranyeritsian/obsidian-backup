**Early Life and Education**
Born in Stagira, 384 BCE. Studied under Plato at The Academy for approximately 20 years. Recognized by Plato for his genius.

**Tutoring Alexander**
Appointed tutor to Alexander the Great by King Philip II of Macedon. Briefly influenced Alexander, who later saw him as a second father. Alexander conquered the world; Aristotle sought truth.

**The Lyceum**
Founded his school, the Lyceum, in 347 BCE. Well-funded due to his connection with Alexander. Emphasized biological sciences, creating a vast zoological collection. Worked with primitive tools.

**Vast Works**
Attributed hundreds, possibly up to 1,000 works. Earned the moniker "The Encyclopedia." Covered scientific, logical, aesthetic, and philosophical fields. Some works likely compiled by students; Aristotle is the spiritual author. Literary dialogues are lost.

**Logic**
Pioneered formal logic. Emphasized clear definitions (group and distinguishing traits). Developed the syllogism (major premise, minor premise, conclusion) for clarification and exposition, not discovering universal truths. Key works include "Categories," "Topics," "Prior Analytics."

**Natural Sciences**
Organized early scientific knowledge. Pioneered meteorology (hydrological cycle). Observed species, believed gradual transitions between animate and inanimate. Classified humans as mammals, seeing monkeys as intermediates. Founded embryology. Made errors due to limited tools and prior knowledge.

**Metaphysics**
Based on form and matter. Form is the inner impulse realizing matter's potential. Matter without form leads to the question of origins. Introduced the "Prime Mover Unmoved" as the eternal, incorporeal driving force of nature. Soul is the vital principle in all animate things; in humans, it includes passive (individual reason) and active (universal thought) aspects.

**Ethics**
Happiness is the ultimate human goal, achieved through reason and the "golden mean" (virtue as the moderate middle between extremes). Requires habit formation, rational thought, self-control, and practice. Material goods and genuine friendship are necessary. The wise man finds perfect happiness in the operation of the intellect, self-sufficient and unwearied.

**Politics**
Political thought was conservative, valuing tradition and fearing revolution's unintended destruction. Opposed communism, citing human nature's self-interest. Analyzed government forms: Monarchy (virtuous rule ideal, but corrupts), Aristocracy (superior to Monarchy, degrades to Plutocracy), Polity/Democracy (less corruptible but flawed by confusing equality among unequals). Advocated constitutional government based on meritocracy, education tailored to the government, rule of law, and state-controlled marriage. Held conservative views on women's role in politics.

**Death and Legacy**
Died in exile in Chalcis, 322 BCE, after fleeing Athens similar to Socrates. Accused of blasphemy. His influence dominated European philosophy for over a millennium until challenged by figures like Occam, Bacon, and Ramus. Errors are acknowledged but attributed to his era's limitations; his systematic approach and vast scope remain monumental.
