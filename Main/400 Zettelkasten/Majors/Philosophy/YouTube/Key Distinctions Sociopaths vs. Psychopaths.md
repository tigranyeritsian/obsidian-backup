**Definitions and Official Status**
Sociopathy is often used colloquially for antisocial personality disorder, while psychopathy is not an official diagnosis and is used arbitrarily to describe someone lacking conscience.

**Origins**
Psychopathy is believed to have a strong genetic predisposition ("born that way"). Sociopathy is primarily influenced by environmental factors like childhood trauma, family issues, or peer pressure.

**Behavior and Planning**
Psychopaths are meticulous planners, highly successful at concealing their true nature and manipulating others. Sociopaths are generally more impulsive, erratic, and less able to hide their feelings.

**Emotions and Relationships**
Psychopaths exhibit shallow emotional responses, lack empathy, and form superficial, manipulative relationships. Sociopaths may struggle with attachments but can sometimes form genuine emotional bonds with difficulty and experience remorse.

**Criminal Behavior**
Psychopaths plan crimes meticulously without guilt, seeing others as puppets. Sociopaths commit crimes impulsively, often during angry outbursts, and may later feel remorse.

**Relationship Success**
Psychopaths are generally more successful than sociopaths in maintaining family and work relationships due to their ability to conceal their nature.
