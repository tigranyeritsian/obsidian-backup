This video compares the social contract philosophies of three prominent Enlightenment thinkers: Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

Here's a breakdown of each philosopher's core ideas:

Thomas Hobbes: Believed human nature is inherently destructive, leading to chaos and violence if left unchecked. Argued for a strong, authoritative ruler (the "Leviathan") to maintain security, with people voluntarily surrendering their freedom for protection. His famous quote: "In the state of nature people are in that condition which is called war... and the life of man solitary poor nasty brutish and short."

John Locke: Believed people are born with a "tabula rasa" (blank slate) and would naturally improve society given freedom. Advocated for a limited government that protects life, liberty, and property. Emphasized the right of people to consent to their government and to overthrow leaders who do not act in their interests, often through elections. His famous quote: "Men all being naturally free equal and independent so no one can be deprived of this freedom and subjected to the political power of someone else without his own consent."

Jean-Jacques Rousseau: Contended that society and its structures corrupt individuals, leading to inequality and societal disintegration. Believed in direct democracy where decisions are made by the community for the "general will," promoting equality among individuals. His famous quote: "Man is born free but everywhere in chains."

The video concludes by noting that modern societies often draw upon these philosophies, with liberal democracies most closely aligning with Locke's ideas of protecting personal freedom and property. The central challenge discussed is the extent to which government should limit individual freedom for the sake of security.
