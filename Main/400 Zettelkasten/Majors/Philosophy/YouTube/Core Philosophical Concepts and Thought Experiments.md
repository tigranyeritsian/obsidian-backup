**Plato's Allegory of the Cave**  
Illustrates humans mistaking sensory perception for true reality. Prisoners chained in a cave see shadows as real; freed, they struggle to accept the external world. Enlightenment requires painful detachment from comforting illusions to perceive genuine forms.

**The Ship of Theseus**  
Explores identity through gradual change. If a ship has all its planks replaced, is it still the same ship? If original planks rebuild a second ship, which is authentic? Questions whether identity depends on physical continuity or the sum of parts at a single moment.

**The Trolley Problem**  
Ethical dilemma forcing a choice: actively kill one to save five (utilitarianism) or do nothing (deontological ethics). Variations, like pushing a person onto tracks, show moral judgments rely on emotional principles beyond pure logic.

**Determinism vs. Free Will**  
Determinism holds all events, including actions, are caused by prior factors. Free Will argues for genuine agency. Compatibilism suggests coexistence: actions are influenced but remain choices. Neuroscience challenges conscious decision-making, yet humans experience life as free.

**Existential Angst**  
Deep anxiety from confronting life's inherent meaninglessness. Individuals realize the universe is indifferent and must create purpose alone. Embracing this freedom through authentic living, despite uncertainty, is both unsettling and liberating.

**Nihilism**  
Rejects inherent meaning, value, or purpose in life. Moral nihilism denies objective right/wrong; existential nihilism claims life lacks meaning. Nietzsche warned against passive despair, advocating active nihilism to forge personal purpose.

**Solipsism**  
Asserts only one's own mind is certain to exist; everything else could be illusion. Rene Descartes' "cogito ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am") affirms thinking self but struggles to prove external reality. Practical life generally rejects this view.

**Problem of Evil**  
Questions how an all-powerful, all-knowing, benevolent God allows suffering. Responses include Free Will defense (evil enables choice), soul-making (suffering builds virtue), or limitations of human understanding. Atheists see suffering as evidence against such a deity.

**Paradox of the Heap (Sorites Paradox)**  
Highlights vagueness in language. Removing one grain of sand from a heap leaves it a heap; at what point does it cease? Applies to concepts like baldness or wealth, showing boundaries are often arbitrary and reality resists clear definition.

**Dualism vs. Monism**  
Dualism (e.g., Descartes) posits mind (non-physical) and body (physical) as separate substances. Monism argues one fundamental substance: materialism (mind is brain activity) or idealism (reality is mental). Neuroscience supports materialism but faces the "hard problem" of subjective experience.

**Moral Relativism**  
Morality is context-dependent, shaped by culture, history, or individual perspective, not absolute. Challenges include ethical nihilism (if no standard is better, condemning oppression becomes difficult) and debates about universal human rights.

**Tabula Rasa**  
Locke's concept of the mind as a "blank slate" at birth, shaped solely by experience. Modern science suggests innate traits (e.g., infant preferences), supporting a nature-nurture interaction. Emphasizes environment's role in development.

**The Absurd**  
Humanity's futile search for meaning in an indifferent universe (Camus). Embracing the absurd means rejecting imposed beliefs to create purpose authentically, finding liberation in the struggle itself (e.g., Sisyphus finding joy in his task).

**Eternal Recurrence**  
Nietzsche's thought experiment: reliving life infinitely. Challenges whether one would affirm it. Tests authenticity and strength; "amor fati" (love of fate) represents embracing life completely, including suffering.

**Social Contract Theory**  
Societies form via implicit agreements where individuals surrender some freedoms for security (Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau). Explores balance between individual liberty and societal order, justifying rebellion when rights are violated.

**Veil of Ignorance**  
Rawls' thought experiment: designing society without knowing one's position (rich/poor, healthy/sick). Rational individuals would prioritize fairness, protecting the vulnerable, leading to principles of justice as fairness.

**Is-Ought Problem (Hume's Guillotine)**  
Critiques deriving moral "ought" from factual "is." Observing how the world is doesn't logically dictate how it should be. Highlights the gap between description and prescription, central to ethical reasoning.

**Hedonism**  
Views pleasure as the highest good. Epicurean hedonism emphasizes long-term well-being over fleeting gratification. Criticized for potential shallowness; utilitarianism refines it to maximize happiness for the greatest number.

**Pascal's Wager**  
Pragmatic argument for belief in God: potential infinite reward outweighs finite costs of belief if God exists. Criticized for assuming a specific God, treating belief as a choice, and basing faith on self-interest.

**Cogito Ergo Sum**  
Descartes' foundational truth: doubting proves the existence of a thinking self ("I think, therefore I am"). Survives radical skepticism but faces questions about the nature of the "I" and external reality.

**Euthyphro Dilemma**  
Asks if something is good because gods command it (arbitrary) or gods command it because it is good (morality independent of divine will). Challenges divine command ethics and suggests morality may exist beyond gods.

**Golden Mean**  
Aristotle's virtue ethics: moral virtue lies between extremes (e.g., courage between cowardice and recklessness). Requires practical wisdom (phronesis) to discern context-dependent balance, focusing on character development.

**Ockham's Razor**  
Principle favoring the simplest explanation with the fewest assumptions. Applied in science (e.g., Occam's Razor in diagnosis) and philosophy, but criticized for potentially oversimplifying complex realities.

**Principle of Sufficient Reason**  
Everything that exists must have a reason or explanation. Associated with Leibniz, it underpins scientific inquiry but faces challenges (e.g., quantum randomness) and infinite regress issues.

**Gettier Problem**  
Challenges the justified true belief (JTB) definition of knowledge. Shows cases where belief is true and justified but not knowledge due to luck (e.g., seeing a car believed to be Sarah's, but it's a rental; she bought another that day).

**Categorical Imperative**  
Kant's moral principle: act only on maxims that can become universal laws. Treat humanity as an end, never merely a means. Emphasizes duty, universalizability, and moral consistency over consequences.

**Mind-Body Problem**  
Explores the relationship between mind/consciousness and the physical body. Dualism (mind/body separate) struggles with interaction; monism (materialism/idealism) faces the "hard problem" of explaining subjective experience from physical processes.

**Akrasia (Weakness of Will)**  
Acting against one's better judgment (e.g., unhealthy eating despite knowing it's bad). Plato attributed it to ignorance; Aristotle saw it as failure of self-control. Psychology supports limited willpower influenced by emotions and habits.

**Dialectical Materialism**  
Marx/Engels' framework: history evolves through class struggle driven by material conditions (economy, labor). Contradictions within economic systems (e.g., capitalism) drive revolutionary change, shaping ideology.

**Experience Machine**  
Nozick's thought experiment: a machine offering perfect simulated happiness. Most people reject it, valuing reality, autonomy, and authenticity over mere pleasure, challenging hedonism.

**Utilitarianism**  
Ethical theory judging actions by their consequences: the greatest good for the greatest number. Bentham's hedonic calculus measures pleasure/pain; Mill distinguishes higher/lower pleasures. Criticized for potential tyranny of the majority.

**Zeno's Paradoxes**  
Challenges motion and infinity (e.g., Achilles never catches the tortoise). Modern calculus resolves apparent contradictions using limits, but they persist in questioning reality's nature.

**Anthropic Principle**  
Universe appears fine-tuned for life because, if not, we wouldn't exist to observe it. Weak (observation bias) vs. Strong (universe must allow life). Raises questions about design vs. multiverse possibilities.

**Liar Paradox**  
Self-referential contradiction: "This statement is false." If true, it's false; if false, it's true. Highlights limits of logic and language, influencing theories of truth and meaning.

**Problem of Induction**  
Hume's challenge: just because something happened repeatedly doesn't guarantee future occurrences. Undermines certainty in empirical knowledge and scientific reasoning, relying on habit or probability.

**Falsificationism**  
Popper's philosophy: science progresses by attempting to disprove theories, not confirm them. A theory is scientific only if testable and potentially falsifiable (e.g., finding a black swan disproves "all swans are white").

**Butterfly Effect**  
Chaos theory principle: small changes in initial conditions lead to vastly different outcomes. Highlights sensitivity in complex systems (weather, ecosystems) and challenges predictability and determinism.

**Sorites Paradox**  
See Paradox of the Heap. Challenges vague language and gradual change in definitions (e.g., heap, baldness), questioning how we categorize the world.

**Lottery Paradox**  
Kyburg's puzzle: it's rational to believe each lottery ticket will lose (high probability), but also rational to believe one ticket will win. Highlights tension between probabilistic reasoning and collective inconsistency.

**Buridan's Ass**  
Paradox: a donkey starves choosing between two equal piles of hay. Illustrates limits of pure rationality in decision-making; suggests spontaneity or randomness is needed.

**Meta-Ethics**  
Examines the nature, origin, and meaning of morality itself. Debates objectivity (moral realism) vs. subjectivity (anti-realism), cognitivism (moral statements express facts) vs. non-cognitivism (expressions/emotion).

**Argument from Illusion**  
Challenges sensory reliability: if senses sometimes deceive (e.g., bent stick in water), how do we know they aren't always deceiving? Leads to skepticism about perceiving reality directly.

**Open Question Argument**  
Moore's critique of ethical naturalism: defining "good" as a natural property (e.g., pleasure) leaves "Is pleasure good?" meaningfully open, showing goodness is simple and indefinable.

**Death of the Author**  
Barthes' theory: a text's meaning emerges from the reader's interaction, not the author's intent. Rejects biographical criticism, emphasizing infinite interpretations and the text's independence.

**Identity of Indiscernibles**  
Leibniz's principle: if two things share all properties, they are identical. Challenges quantum mechanics (indistinguishable particles) and questions what truly constitutes individuality.

**Hard Problem of Consciousness**  
Chalmers' term: explaining *why* physical brain processes produce subjective experience (e.g., why seeing red feels like something). Materialism struggles to bridge the explanatory gap.

**Gaia Hypothesis**  
Lovelock's idea: Earth functions as a self-regulating organism where life maintains habitability (e.g., oxygen regulation). Challenges views of Earth as passive; influences ecology and climate science.

**Free Rider Problem**  
Individuals benefit from public goods/services without contributing (e.g., avoiding taxes but using public transport). Highlights collective action problems in economics, politics, and environmental issues.

**Simulation Hypothesis**  
Bostrom's argument: statistically, we are likely living in an advanced computer simulation if civilizations can create them. Raises questions about reality, consciousness, and free will.

**Skepticism**  
Philosophical position doubting the certainty of knowledge. Challenges sensory reliability (illusions), moral truths, and religious claims. Balances doubt with pragmatic belief (e.g., Hume).

**Eternalism vs. Presentism**  
Eternalism: past, present, future exist equally (block universe). Presentism: only the present moment is real. Debate aligns with relativity (eternalism) vs. common sense (presentism), impacting free will and time.

**Ontological Argument**  
Anselm's logical proof: God is "that than which nothing greater can be conceived," so must exist in reality to be the greatest. Criticized (Kant: existence isn't a property) but remains influential.

**Mereological Paradox**  
Explores wholes vs. parts (e.g., Ship of Theseus). Questions if composite objects truly exist or are just collections of parts (mereological nihilism) or how identity is maintained through change.

**Quietism**  
Philosophical stance suggesting many problems arise from language misuse; best response is non-engagement. Encourages focusing on living and communication over deep metaphysical questions.

**Paradox of Choice**  
Schwartz' idea: too many options lead to anxiety, indecision, and dissatisfaction. Distinguishes maximizers (seek best option, often unhappy) from satisficers (settle for good enough, happier).

**Copernican Principle**  
Humans occupy no privileged position in the universe (Earth not the center). Influences cosmology, challenging human exceptionalism and suggesting mediocrity.

**Socratic Irony**  
Socrates' technique of feigned ignorance to expose contradictions in others' beliefs. Central to the Socratic method, fostering critical self-reflection.

**Naturalistic Fallacy**  
Moore's critique: deriving moral "ought" from natural "is" (e.g., "because X is natural, X is good"). Highlights the gap between description and prescription in ethics.

**Evil Demon Hypothesis**  
Descartes' radical skepticism: an omnipotent demon deceives us about reality. Survives doubt ("cogito ergo sum"), establishing the thinking self as foundational.

**Hume's Guillotine**  
See Is-Ought Problem. The logical gap between descriptive statements and moral prescriptions.

**No True Scotsman Fallacy**  
Redefining a category ad hoc to exclude counterexamples (e.g., "No *true* Scotsman puts sugar on porridge" when presented with one). Form of circular reasoning avoiding contradiction.

**Moore's Paradox**  
Contradiction in asserting belief while denying it (e.g., "It's raining, but I don't believe it"). Highlights the coherence of belief and self-awareness.

**Paradox of Tolerance**  
Popper's argument: unlimited tolerance allows intolerant groups to destroy it. May require restricting intolerance to preserve a tolerant society.

**Russell's Paradox**  
Set theory contradiction: does the set of all sets not containing themselves contain itself? Exposed flaws in early logic, leading to modern set theory (e.g., ZFC).

**Paradox of Omnipotence**  
Can an omnipotent being create a rock too heavy to lift? Challenges the coherence of unlimited power; responses suggest omnipotence excludes logical impossibilities.

**Prisoner's Dilemma**  
Game theory scenario: rational self-interest leads to collective worse outcome (both betraying). Highlights conflict between individual and collective benefit, influencing economics and ethics.

**Lottery Fallacy**  
Assuming improbable events cannot happen (e.g., lottery win must be rigged). Mistaking high improbability for impossibility in large systems.

**Problem of the Criterion**  
Chisholm's dilemma: circularity (justifying knowledge with known knowledge) or infinite regress (endless justifications). Responses include foundationalism (self-evident beliefs) or coherentism (web of beliefs).

**Hume's Problem of Miracles**  
Miracles (violations of natural law) are less probable than errors in testimony. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence; skepticism towards miracle reports.

**Infinite Regress Problem**  
Justifications requiring endless chains (e.g., causes needing causes). Responses include foundationalism (basic beliefs), coherentism (mutual justification), or accepting a first cause.

**Raven Paradox**  
Hempel's puzzle: observing a non-black non-raven (e.g., a green apple) confirms "All ravens are black" via contraposition. Challenges theories of confirmation and relevance in science.

**Dunning-Kruger Effect**  
Cognitive bias: low-ability individuals overestimate competence; high-ability individuals underestimate it. Lack of self-awareness fuels overconfidence; expertise fosters humility.

**Münchhausen Trilemma**  
Any justification leads to infinite regress, circular reasoning, or axiomatic assumptions. Highlights the difficulty of absolute justification; solutions include coherentism.

**Mereological Nihilism**  
Radical view: composite objects (tables, people) don't truly exist; only fundamental particles do. Challenges common-sense ontology and personal identity.

**Tragedy of the Commons**  
Shared resources depleted by individuals acting in self-interest (e.g., overgrazing). Solutions include regulation, privatization, or community management.

**Panpsychism**  
Consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe, present in all things (e.g., particles). Attempts to solve the "hard problem of consciousness" but faces scientific criticism.

**Terror Management Theory**  
Human behavior (beliefs, values) stems from managing mortality awareness. Symbolic immortality (religion, culture) alleviates existential terror.

**Quantum Superposition & Philosophy**  
Particles exist in multiple states until measured. Challenges reality's objectivity and determinism; interpretations (e.g., many worlds) have philosophical implications.

**Egoism vs. Altruism**  
Debate on whether human behavior is fundamentally self-interested (egoism) or capable of genuine concern for others (altruism). Involves psychology, evolution, and ethics.

**Chinese Room Argument**  
Searle's critique: AI manipulates symbols without understanding (like a person translating Chinese via rules). Challenges strong AI and claims that computation equals understanding.

**Compatibilism**  
Free will and determinism coexist; free will is acting according to one's desires without coercion. Redefines freedom beyond absolute independence from causality.

**Logical Positivism**  
Meaningful statements must be empirically verifiable or logically provable. Rejects metaphysics/ethics as meaningless; influenced philosophy of science.

**Ontological Shock**  
Radical disruption of reality understanding (e.g., scientific discoveries, philosophical revelations). Can be disorienting but transformative.

**Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems**  
No formal system can be both complete and consistent. Some truths are unprovable within their system; impacts mathematics, logic, and AI limits.

**Frankfurt Cases**  
Thought experiments showing moral responsibility without ability to do otherwise (e.g., neuroscientist forces action if not chosen freely). Supports compatibilism.

**Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism**  
Planta's claim: if naturalism and evolution are true, cognitive faculties evolved for survival, not truth, undermining reliability. Challenges scientific realism under naturalism.

**Cartesian Theater**  
Critique of a central "screen of consciousness" where experiences are presented. Dennett argues for distributed neural processing without a central observer.

**Extended Mind Hypothesis**  
Mind extends into the environment via tools (e.g., notebooks, smartphones). Cognitive processes aren't confined to the brain; challenges traditional views.

**Phenomenology**  
Study of conscious experience from a first-person perspective. Focuses on how reality is perceived and lived (Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre).

**Gavagai Problem**  
Quine's challenge: determining word meaning without context (e.g., "gavagai" meaning rabbit, animal, or moving thing). Highlights translation ambiguity and role of context.

**Argument from Moral Disagreement**  
Persistent moral conflicts suggest no objective truths (relativism). Realists argue disagreement doesn't negate objectivity; bias or ignorance may explain disputes.

**Searle's Biological Naturalism**  
Consciousness is a biological feature of the brain, irreducible to computation. Rejects strong AI but sees consciousness as natural and emerging from neural processes.

**Hyperobjects**  
Morton's concept: vast, distributed entities (e.g., climate change, nuclear radiation) exceeding human perception and control. Challenges agency and ethics.

**Paradox of Fiction**  
Feeling real emotions toward known unreal characters (e.g., crying over a movie). Theories include pretense, imagination triggering real emotion, or connection to universal experiences.

**Scandal of Induction**  
Hume's problem: inductive reasoning (future resembles past) lacks logical justification but is indispensable. Responses include pragmatism or falsificationism.

**Moral Dumbfounding**  
Strong moral judgments lacking reasoned justification (e.g., incest disgust). Suggests emotions drive moral judgments more than logic, supporting moral intuitionism.

**Boltzmann Brains**  
Cosmological paradox: in an infinite/universe, random fluctuations might create conscious brains with false memories more easily than an ordered universe. Questions reality's reliability.

**Deontic Logic**  
Formal logic for obligations, permissions, and prohibitions. Used in ethics and AI programming, but faces paradoxes (e.g., conflicting duties).

**Problem of Dirty Hands**  
Moral dilemma where leaders must commit immoral acts for greater good (e.g., lying to save lives). Challenges deontological ethics and rigid moral rules.
