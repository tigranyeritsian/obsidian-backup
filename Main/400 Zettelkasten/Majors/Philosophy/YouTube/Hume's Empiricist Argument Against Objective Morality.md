## The Empiricist Principle

The text presents an evolving principle about what we should rationally believe exists:

1. Initial version: Only believe in what you personally experience
2. Problem: This is too restrictive (wouldn't allow belief in Madagascar or platypuses you haven't seen)
3. Revised version: Only believe in what you or trustworthy others have experienced
4. Final version: Only believe in what you or others have experienced, OR what must exist to explain what we've experienced

## Hume's Application to Morality

Hume applies this empiricist principle to moral properties:

- When examining a vicious action (like throwing puppies off a bridge), we can observe physical properties (brown fur, salty tears) and mental states (motives, thoughts)
- However, we cannot observe the "wrongness" or "viciousness" itself in the action
- The moral quality isn't found in the external action but in our internal sentiment of disapprobation (disapproval)

## The Conclusion

Just as we reject mermaids because we've found no evidence of them, Hume argues we should reject objective moral properties because we cannot observe them in actions. For Hume, morality isn't an objective feature of the world but rather a subjective feeling within us - a sentiment of approval or disapproval toward certain actions.
