Aristotle's Classification of Government**
Aristotle categorized governments into true forms (monarchy, aristocracy, polity) and their perverted counterparts (tyranny, oligarchy, democracy). Oligarchy is the perverted form of aristocracy, shifting focus from the virtuous best (aristos) to the wealthy few.

**Oligarchy Defined**
Oligarchy is rule by the wealthy few where political power serves their self-interest (wealth preservation/expansion) rather than the common good. Power is gained and maintained primarily through wealth and property, contrasting with aristocracy's merit-based selection and tyranny's reliance on force.

**Characteristics of Oligarchy**
*   Power concentrated within the wealthy elite.
*   Laws and policies favor the rich (e.g., lucrative contracts, monopolies, protective regulations).
*   Wealth becomes the dominant, or sole, criterion for political office.
*   Appearance of legitimacy exists but power is self-serving.
*   Distrust of the populace; may employ mercenaries or limit access to cities.
*   Exists on a spectrum, from extreme to forms with a gatekeeping inner circle.

**How Oligarchy Arises**
Oligarchy often develops gradually from systems like polity, democracy, or aristocracy. A small group accumulates wealth, gains political influence, shapes policies to increase wealth further, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. Over time, wealth overshadows merit in leadership selection.

**How Oligarchy Maintains Power**
*   Reinforces class distinctions (e.g., controlling education).
*   Seizes control of the legal system to serve elite interests.
*   Exerts influence over key industries, trade, and culture.
*   Forges strong social, economic, and political alliances among elites.
*   Concentrates power and wealth, leading to a decline in public virtue.

**Instability of Oligarchies**
Aristotle deemed oligarchies inherently unstable, primarily due to:
*   Revolt from the oppressed poor fueled by social tension.
*   Conflict within the ruling elite (greed leading to internal strife).
*   Rise of populist leaders exploiting discontent.
*   Generational decline: Elite children become weak, while the poor's children become tough and capable of rebellion.
