This detailed historical account chronicles the rapid collapse of the mighty Inca Empire at the hands of Spanish conquistadors led by Francisco Pizarro. The narrative begins with the empire already weakened by European disease (likely smallpox) that killed Emperor Huayna Capac and his designated heir, triggering a devastating civil war between brothers Atahualpa and Huascar.

Despite having only 168 men, Pizarro exploited this internal division, capturing Atahualpa at Cajamarca through deception and superior weaponry. Though Atahualpa paid an enormous ransom in gold and silver (filling a room 22x17 feet), the Spanish executed him anyway. They then installed puppet rulers while systematically plundering the empire's wealth and cultural treasures.

The Inca resistance continued under Manco Inca, who initially cooperated with the Spanish before leading a massive rebellion. Though the siege of Cusco initially showed promise, Spanish technological advantages and internal divisions eventually overwhelmed the Inca forces. Manco Inca established a Neo-Inca State in the remote jungle region of Vilcabamba but was eventually betrayed and killed by Spanish allies.

The conquest was completed in 1572 with the capture and execution of the last Inca ruler, Tupac Amaru. The Spanish colonial system exploited indigenous labor, particularly in silver mines like Potosi, causing tremendous population decline. Despite this devastation, elements of Inca culture—language, roads, and architecture—endured as silent witnesses to their once-great civilization.
