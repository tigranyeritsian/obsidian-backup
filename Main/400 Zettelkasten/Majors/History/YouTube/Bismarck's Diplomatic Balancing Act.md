**European Context Post-Unification**
German unification in 1871 profoundly altered the European balance of power. The new empire emerged as a major power after defeating Denmark, Austria, and France. Key consequences included the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine from France, creating lasting enmity, and permanently shifting the multipolar landscape involving France, Russia, Austria-Hungary, Britain, Italy, and the Ottoman Empire.

**Bismarck's Primary Objectives**
Bismarck's main foreign policy goal was peace. He aimed to consolidate Germany's gains internally and avoid being drawn into conflicts serving others' interests. This necessitated sophisticated alliance-building to prevent German encirclement and maintain the European balance of power.

**The Three Emperors League**
Bismarck initially pursued the League of the Three Emperors (1873) with Austria-Hungary and Russia. This alliance aimed to isolate France and Britain, coordinate on suppressing Polish nationalism and socialism, and manage Balkan tensions. While initially successful, the inherent conflict between Austrian and Russian interests in the Balkans proved a critical weakness.

**The Balkan Crisis and League Strain**
The decline of Ottoman power sparked crises in the Balkans (1875 onwards). Bismarck feared Austria and Russia clashing, forcing him to choose between them or risking encirclement. He insisted they negotiate a partition plan. The Reichtag Agreement (1876) proposed Austria annexing Bosnia-Herzegovina and Russia annexing Bessarabia, with Bulgaria autonomous. Subsequent Russo-Turkish war (1877-78) and the Treaty of San Stefano threatened this balance.

**Congress of Berlin and Russian Alienation**
To revise the Treaty of San Stefano and prevent a wider war, the Congress of Berlin (1878) convened. Bismarck acted as an "honest broker," facilitating a compromise that significantly reduced Bulgaria's size and satisfied Austria-Hungary and Britain. However, Russia felt betrayed and alienated by Germany's role, leading to the dissolution of the Three Emperors League. Bismarck prioritized Austria-Hungary due to shared vulnerability, cultural ties, and the need to preserve its stability against Russian expansionism and internal disintegration.

**Alliance System Evolution**
The dissolution of the Three Emperors League led Bismarck to consolidate the Dual Alliance (1879) with Austria-Hungary, later expanded into the Triple Alliance (1881). He simultaneously pursued the Reinsurance Treaty (1887) with Russia to maintain flexibility. This complex system aimed to balance Austria-Hungary and Russia while isolating France, relying on Bismarck's personal skill and adaptability. This intricate structure collapsed after Bismarck's dismissal in 1890.
