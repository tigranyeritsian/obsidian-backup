**Background and Start of Espionage**
*   February 18th, 2001: FBI surrounded Robert Hansen during a dead drop in a park, ending his 22-year espionage career.
*   1979: Hansen, a former Chicago cop and new FBI agent, offered top-secret US intelligence to the GRU for $20,000, naming three Soviet double agents (including informant Dimmitri Pyakov, who was executed).
*   The FBI didn't suspect him; the Soviets didn't reveal their source, allowing Hansen to continue.

**Methods and Escapades**
*   Operated anonymously for decades, using dead drops, coded messages, and encrypted files.
*   Lived a seemingly ordinary life: devout Catholic, family man with six children, modest suburban home.
*   Pausing in the mid-1980s, he resumed spying for the KGB under aliases "Ramon" and "B".
*   Leaked devastating secrets, including a $100 million surveillance tunnel beneath the Soviet embassy, rendering it useless.
*   Earned over $1.4 million in cash, diamonds, and deposits; motivated by the thrill of feeling untouchable.
*   Outsmarted FBI counterintelligence for years, mocking their amateur tactics and adapting to their security measures.

**The Downfall**
*   Mid-1990s: FBI knew a high-level mole existed but wrongly focused CIA officer Brian Kelly.
*   Late 2000: Paid $7 million for a Russian intelligence file containing a voice recording and a partial fingerprint on a torn plastic trash bag used for a drop.
*   Forensic analysis matched the weak fingerprint to Robert Hansen.
*   FBI built a trap: moved Hansen to a fictional HQ job to contain him, closely monitored him, and prepared for a final drop.

**Aftermath and Death**
*   February 18th, 2001: Despite suspecting he was compromised, Hansen performed a drop at Foxstone Park. He was arrested immediately and uttered, "What took you so long?"
*   Arrested for espionage, reflecting a severe national security breach.
*   Remained silent during interrogation, pleaded guilty to 15 counts to avoid the death penalty.
*   May 10th, 2002: Sentenced to life in prison without parole.
*   Died unresponsive in his prison cell on June 5th, 2023, after 21 years in isolation.

**Motivation**
*   Hansen provided no justification for his actions. His final question, "What took you so long?", suggested his primary motive was the challenge and feeling of superiority over the FBI system he betrayed.
