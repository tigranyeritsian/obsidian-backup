**The Challenge of Conquering the USSR**
Invading the Soviet Union in 1941 was an immense task due to its vast size and the "war to the death" strategy. Even with numerous Axis allies (Finland, Romania, Hungary, Italy, Slovakia) and later foreign SS volunteers, victory remained near impossible.

**Existing Anti-Soviet Sentiment**
The Soviet Union was widely hated globally, seen as a pariah state promoting world revolution. Its brutal early history (crushed revolts, famine like the Holodomor, terror in the Baltics) created deep resentment among Ukrainians, Balts, Russians, and others in the occupied territories. Many initially welcomed German forces as liberators.

**Hitler's Missed Opportunities**
Instead of exploiting this sentiment, Hitler's distrust and vague policies alienated potential allies. He failed to offer clear, concrete promises of independence or autonomy for nations like Ukraine or the Baltics. While some foreign SS units were recruited (e.g., Latvian Legion, French Charlemagne), this was a fraction of the possible support. Millions of Soviet prisoners and defectors were mistreated instead of being mobilized effectively.

**Consequences of Alienation**
The lack of a coherent policy and Hitler's distrust prevented mobilizing the vast manpower available from anti-Soviet populations across the USSR and occupied Europe. This failure seriously hindered the German war effort against numerically superior Soviet forces.

**What If?**
If Hitler had offered clearer visions of self-determination and autonomy, it could have triggered a massive uprising and defections, potentially leading to a second Russian civil war. A German-friendly Russian state, however reduced, might have emerged. Instead, Eastern Europe suffered under Soviet domination for decades.
