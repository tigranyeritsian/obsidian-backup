Rhodesian War: A Justified Defense of Civilization**

**Historical Context**
Rhodesia was a prosperous, self-governing British colony with high living standards for all races, attracting African immigrants. After WWII, Britain betrayed promises of independence, granting it to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland while withholding it from Southern Rhodesia.

**Rhodesian Achievements**
European settlers transformed Rhodesia from a "barbarous land" into a model of civilization with advanced infrastructure, education, and healthcare. Ian Smith emphasized the responsible government and loyalty shown to Britain over 40 years.

**Threat of African Rule**
Rhodesians feared immediate majority rule based on the collapse of newly independent African states into dictatorship and anarchy. Examples like the Congo highlighted brutal violence and the failure of democracy as a foreign concept.

**Rhodesian Stance**
Ian Smith advocated for a gradual transition to majority rule once the African population was ready, emphasizing education and meritocracy. The existing system included multi-racial voting based on property/income criteria, though many Africans preferred traditional tribal life.

**Negotiation Failures**
Rhodesia offered concessions but refused immediate, unconditional majority rule. British negotiations involved complex, phased plans often undermined by international pressure from newly independent African states demanding Rhodesia's destruction.

**International Pressure & Betrayal**
Rhodesia faced sanctions and isolation. Britain, sympathetic but constrained by post-WWII sentiment and pressure from Afro-Asian Commonwealth nations, ultimately betrayed Rhodesia again. South Africa also abandoned Rhodesia. Rhodesian military victories were irrelevant against global opposition.

**Consequences of Majority Rule**
After the 1980 election, widely considered rigged, Zimbabwe descended into economic collapse, hyperinflation, unemployment reaching 95%, famine, and tribal violence. The white population plummeted, and many Africans acknowledge life was better under Smith.

**Legacy and Relevance**
The Rhodesian story illustrates the failure of emotional, anti-colonial politics overriding practical concerns. Rhodesians are a scattered diaspora. The author frames Rhodesia's fall as a warning for the West, emphasizing the need to resist similar "madness" and defend civilization.
