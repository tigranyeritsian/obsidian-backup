A **luxury index** in finance serves as a barometer for the economic health and performance of the world's leading publicly-traded companies that produce and sell high-end consumer goods and services.1 Think of it as a specialized stock market index, similar to the S&P 500, but instead of tracking a broad market, it focuses exclusively on the purveyors of luxury.2 These indices are closely watched by investors and analysts as they can be indicative of overall consumer confidence and the spending habits of the wealthy.

The most prominent benchmark in this sector is the **S&P Global Luxury Index**. This index comprises 80 of the largest and most liquid companies engaged in the production or distribution of luxury goods or the provision of luxury services.3 These companies span a range of industries, including high-fashion and leather goods, automobiles, hotels, and cosmetics.4

### How the S&P Global Luxury Index Works

The S&P Global Luxury Index is a **modified market-capitalization-weighted index**.5 This means that the influence of each company on the index's performance is primarily determined by its total market value. However, the "modified" aspect signifies that adjustments are made to ensure that the index is not overly dominated by a few of the largest companies, promoting a degree of diversification.6

The index is **rebalanced annually** to ensure that it accurately reflects the current state of the luxury market.7 This process involves reviewing the constituent companies and their weightings and making adjustments as needed.

### Beyond the S&P: Other Luxury Indices

While the S&P Global Luxury Index is a key benchmark, other indices also track the performance of the luxury sector. One such example is the **STOXX Europe Luxury 10 Index**, which, as its name suggests, focuses on the 10 largest European luxury goods companies.8

### Investing in the Luxury Market

For those looking to invest in the luxury sector, these indices provide a valuable framework. There are two primary ways to gain exposure to the performance of a luxury index:

- **Individual Stocks:** Investors can purchase shares of the individual companies that are constituents of a luxury index.9 This allows for a targeted investment in specific brands that an investor believes will perform well.
    
- **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs):** A more diversified approach is to invest in an ETF that tracks a luxury index. These funds hold a basket of stocks that mirrors the composition of the underlying index, offering broad exposure to the sector in a single investment.
    

The performance of the luxury goods market is often seen as a leading indicator of economic trends. During periods of economic prosperity, consumers, particularly high-net-worth individuals, tend to increase their spending on luxury items. Conversely, in times of economic uncertainty, this discretionary spending is often the first to be curtailed.10 Therefore, a luxury index can offer valuable insights into the broader economic landscape.
