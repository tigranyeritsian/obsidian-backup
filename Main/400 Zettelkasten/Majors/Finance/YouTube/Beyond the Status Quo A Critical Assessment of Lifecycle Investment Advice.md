The paper "Beyond the Status Quo: A Critical Assessment of Lifecycle Investment Advice" challenges two traditional tenets of lifecycle investing: diversifying across stocks and bonds, and reducing equity allocations with age.

The authors propose an optimal lifetime asset allocation of 33% domestic stocks, 67% international stocks, and 0% in bonds or bills. This all-equity strategy is found to significantly outperform age-based, stock-bond strategies and target-date funds in terms of wealth accumulation, supporting retirement consumption, preserving capital, and generating bequests. For instance, target-date fund investors would need to save 61% more pre-retirement to achieve the same expected utility as the all-equity strategy.

The study uses a comprehensive dataset of monthly real returns for domestic stocks, international stocks, government bonds, and government bills from 39 developed countries, spanning over 2,600 years of country-month data from 1890 to 2023. This approach, using a "block bootstrap" methodology, preserves crucial time-series and cross-sectional dependencies in asset returns that are often ignored in traditional models.

Key findings include:

The all-equity strategy demonstrates better capital preservation, with a lower probability of running out of money in retirement (7.0%) compared to a balanced strategy (16.9%) or a target-date fund (19.7%).

While a fixed all-equity strategy is generally optimal, a small, brief allocation to bills at retirement (27% at age 65, shrinking to 0% by age 70) can slightly optimize outcomes with fixed inflation-adjusted withdrawals. However, this cash allocation becomes unnecessary with flexible spending strategies.

Even with high stock valuations, the optimal portfolio does not drastically change; benefits come from decreasing domestic stock allocation, not from bonds.

The findings are robust across various adjustments, including different sample periods, excluding the US market, or accounting for changing correlations.

The preference for international stocks over bonds for diversification is attributed to bonds' low average real returns, higher long-term variance, higher long-term correlation with domestic stocks, and higher exposure to inflationary periods.

Leverage (borrowing up to 55% of wealth at a low margin rate) on an all-equity portfolio can further decrease the required savings rate.

The authors conclude that despite the all-equity strategy's strong performance, investors and regulators might be uncomfortable with large intermediate drawdowns. However, they argue that traditional diversified portfolios with large bond allocations can carry potential for even larger real drawdowns and expose investors to a greater risk of exhausting their savings. Therefore, an internationally diversified, all-equity strategy is suggested as a "set it and forget it" approach that could benefit retirement savers and retirees.
