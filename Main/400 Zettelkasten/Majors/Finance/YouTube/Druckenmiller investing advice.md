Stanley Druckenmiller shares a piece of advice he received from his first boss in 1976 about timing the stock market in relation to the political cycle. The advice is to buy the market two years before a general election and sell it on the general election. This is because politicians "always rig things to be good in the election year."

Druckenmiller then provides a list of major market bottoms that occurred in years following this pattern, including 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, and 2002.
