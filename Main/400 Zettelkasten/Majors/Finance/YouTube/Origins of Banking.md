Merchants began facilitating trade using their wealth, leading to the establishment of early banks. These banks stored gold for safekeeping and issued receipts as contracts for withdrawal, enabling easier global trade without physical gold transport.

**Money Creation**  
Banks discovered they could lend receipts instead of gold, effectively creating money. For every unit of gold stored, they issued multiple receipts, doubling the apparent money supply while the physical gold remained unchanged.

**System Vulnerabilities**  
The primary risk was bank runs, where simultaneous demands for gold exceeded reserves. Additionally, loans to kings and nobles for wars often defaulted, threatening bank stability.

**Central Banking Emergence**  
Banks formed cartels through intermarriage to mitigate risks. They provided mutual support during bank runs and coordinated to enforce debt repayment, even through force, laying the foundation for modern central banking.

**The Scarcity Myth**  
Contrary to common belief, money is not inherently scarceâ€”it is a numerical construct that can be infinitely created. The perceived scarcity is an illusion maintained by powerful entities.

**Purpose of Poverty**  
Poverty is deliberately sustained to create the illusion that money is valuable. Artificial scarcity motivates labor by linking work to survival, as the wealthy manipulate incentives to maintain control over resources and labor.

**Economic Cycles**  
Crises and wars are engineered to destroy wealth, reinforcing the scarcity narrative. This destruction ensures people continue working under the belief that money must be earned rather than created freely.
