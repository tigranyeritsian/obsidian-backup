This video features an interview with Professor Werner, who discusses the role of the financial sector and banking system, particularly in the UK.

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

Financial Sector's Impact on the Economy The video highlights the historical growth of private debt in the UK since 1880, noting a significant increase post-Thatcher era. Professor Werner explains that national income accountants have struggled to define the "value added" by the financial sector, often resorting to fictional values for GDP calculations because he believes it extracts rather than adds value. He argues that the financial sector has become a cost center rather than a facilitator of business.

Concentration of the Banking Sector Professor Werner points out the highly concentrated nature of the UK banking system, where five banks hold 90% of deposits, making it one of the most concentrated globally. In contrast, Germany has a much more decentralized system with 1,500 local, not-for-profit community banks accounting for 70% of deposits. He links this concentration to a lack of accountability and the "power corrupts" principle.

Banks and Money Creation A core argument presented is that banks do not act as intermediaries that lend out deposits. Instead, Professor Werner asserts that banks create money "out of nothing." He clarifies that what is called a "deposit" is legally a loan to the bank and that banks purchase promissory notes from borrowers, with the "loaned" money appearing as a liability (debt) on the bank's books, effectively creating new money. 97% of the money supply consists of these bank-created deposits.

Productive vs. Unproductive Lending

Productive Lending: When banks create money for productive purposes, such as business investment or new technologies, it can lead to economic growth, low inflation, financial stability, and reduced inequality.

Unproductive Lending: Lending for consumption increases demand for existing goods, leading to consumer price inflation. A significant portion of lending in the UK (over 70%) is for financial transactions and purchasing ownership rights. This creates new money without new goods or services, driving up asset prices (like property) and increasing inequality.

Proposed Solutions and Regulation

Decentralization: Professor Werner advocates for breaking up the financial sector and creating smaller, locally accountable community banks, similar to Germany's model. These smaller banks are better equipped to lend to small firms and have a track record of not requiring public bailouts.

Credit Guidance: He suggests implementing regulation that recognizes banks as money creators, not just intermediaries. The most effective historical regulation has been guidance of bank credit, even to the extent of banning bank credit for financial speculation.

The City of London: The video concludes with a striking point about the City of London, stating it's not actually part of the UK but an international entity with its own unique, undemocratic governance where banks hold votes.
