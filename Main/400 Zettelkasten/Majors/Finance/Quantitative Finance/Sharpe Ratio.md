## Key Points:

### Why Returns Alone Aren't Sufficient

- Two investments can have identical returns (e.g., 40%) but different risk profiles
- The "path" to achieving returns matters - investments with more volatility ("wiggles") are riskier
- Volatility is problematic because it makes investments more painful to hold, reduces confidence in future performance, and creates potential liquidity issues

### Quantifying Risk

- Risk is measured using standard deviation of returns (volatility, denoted by ฯ)
- Volatility captures the deviations from average return - the "wiggles" in return graphs

### The Sharpe Ratio Formula

- Sharpe ratio = (Average daily returns) รท (Volatility)
- Typically multiplied by 252 to annualize the ratio (based on trading days in a year)
- Measures return earned per unit of risk taken

### Practical Examples and Benchmarks

- In the example, a less volatile investment had a Sharpe ratio of 2, while a more volatile one had 0.5
- Higher Sharpe ratios show smoother return curves
- Real-world benchmarks: S&P 500 (~~0.45), Warren Buffett (~~0.75), good hedge funds (2+)

### Portfolio Diversification

- Sharpe ratio helps evaluate how investments combine in a portfolio
- Negatively correlated investments can be combined to create a portfolio with a higher Sharpe ratio
- This demonstrates how diversification works by combining investments that move in opposite ways

### Leverage and Sharpe Ratio

- Leverage amplifies both returns and volatility proportionally
- Importantly, leverage doesn't change the Sharpe ratio
- This allows investors to use leverage on high Sharpe strategies to target higher returns while maintaining the same risk-adjusted performance

### Statistical and Academic Foundations

- Sharpe ratio is proportional to the t-statistic, which measures statistical significance
- Financial theory suggests rational investors should hold the highest Sharpe portfolio (the "tangency portfolio")

## Key Takeaways:

- Returns matter, but so does risk
- Sharpe ratio creates a risk-adjusted measure of performance
- It evaluates both standalone investments and portfolio combinations
- Leverage can enhance high Sharpe strategies
- Achieving a 2+ Sharpe ratio would outperform most investors
