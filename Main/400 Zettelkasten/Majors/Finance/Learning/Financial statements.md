### **II. Financial Statement Analysis Techniques**

#### **1. Horizontal Analysis**

- **What**: Compares line items over multiple periods (e.g., 2022 vs. 2023).
- **Formula**: **% Change = [(Current Year â€“ Prior Year) / Prior Year] Ã— 100**.
- **Use Case**: Identifies trends (e.g., revenue growth 15% YoY).

#### **2. Vertical Analysis**

- **What**: Expresses each line item as a % of a base figure (e.g., revenue for income statement).
- **Use Case**: Reveals cost structure (e.g., COGS = 60% of revenue).

#### **3. Ratio Analysis**

Key ratios grouped by category:

|**Category**|**Key Ratios**|**Formula**|**What It Reveals**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Profitability**|Gross Margin|(Revenue â€“ COGS) / Revenue|Production efficiency|
||Net Profit Margin|Net Income / Revenue|Overall profitability|
||Return on Equity (ROE)|Net Income / Shareholders' Equity|Profit generated from shareholder funds|
||Return on Assets (ROA)|Net Income / Total Assets|Efficiency in using assets|

### **III. Red Flags & Critical Insights**

#### **Income Statement Red Flags**

- **Revenue Growth Without Profit**: Rising sales but shrinking margins (e.g., aggressive discounting).
- **One-Time Gains**: Inflating net income with asset sales or tax benefits.

#### **Balance Sheet Red Flags**

- **High Debt-to-Equity**: >2.0 may signal excessive leverage.
- **Rising Accounts Receivable**: Sales not converting to cash (collection issues).
- **Goodwill > 20% of Assets**: Overpaid acquisitions risk write-downs.

#### **Cash Flow Statement Red Flags**

- **Positive Net Income, Negative Operating Cash Flow**: Earnings aren't cash-backed (e.g., revenue recognized but not collected).
- **Heavy Reliance on Financing Cash**: Funding operations via debt/equity instead of core business.
