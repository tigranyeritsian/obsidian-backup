### **Key Considerations When Using Ratios**  
1. **Context Matters:**  
   - Compare ratios to **industry peers** (e.g., tech vs. utilities).  
   - Analyze **historical trends** (e.g., declining margins = red flag).  
   - Adjust for **accounting policies** (e.g., depreciation methods).  

2. **Limitations:**  
   - **Window Dressing:** Firms may manipulate quarter-end numbers.  
   - **Inflation:** Distorts asset values and historical comparisons.  
   - **Non-Financial Factors:** Brand value, management quality, or R&D aren’t captured.  

3. **Holistic Analysis:**  
   - Combine ratios (e.g., high ROE + high D/E = leverage-driven returns).  
   - Use qualitative analysis (e.g., Porter’s Five Forces) alongside ratios.

### **Where to Find Data**  
- **Financial Statements:** 10-K, 10-Q filings (SEC EDGAR).  
- **Tools:** Bloomberg, Capital IQ, Yahoo Finance, Morningstar.  
- **Industry Benchmarks:** IBISWorld, Statista, trade associations.  

By mastering these ratios, you can dissect a company’s financial health, operational efficiency, and market position—critical for investing, lending, or strategic decision-making.
