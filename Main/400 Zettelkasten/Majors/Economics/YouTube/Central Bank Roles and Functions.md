**Monetary Policy Implementation**
Central banks set interest rates, manage money supply, and aim to meet inflation targets while influencing economic growth and unemployment. They also adjust exchange rates through monetary policy tools like open market operations involving government bond purchases and sales, particularly significant in the US Federal Reserve system. Additionally, central banks act as the government's banker, buying/selling government bonds and potentially reducing the bond interest rates paid.

**Financial Stability: Lender of Last Resort**
A critical post-2008 role is maintaining financial stability through the lender of last resort function, especially for the Bank of England. This involves preventing bank runs and intervening during liquidity crises via two liquidity assurance schemes:
1.  **Non-Emergency Liquidity:** Provides routine, periodic support to banks needing short-term funds (e.g., monthly).
2.  **Emergency Liquidity:** Offers immediate, large-scale liquidity support to banks facing dire liquidity shortages, contingent on systemic risk assessment and requiring repayment with interest and stricter conditions.
Intervention generally targets liquidity crises and systemic risk; insolvent banks (failing due to bad loans/lack of capital) are typically allowed to fail safely, though bailouts might be advised for systemic collapse prevention.

**Financial System Regulation**
Enhanced since the 2008 crisis, central banks regulate the broader financial system to maintain confidence, prevent panic and banking runs, reduce systemic risk, and mitigate the chance of financial system collapse leading to deep recessions. This includes advising on potential bank bailouts deemed necessary for overall economic stability.

**Evaluation of Lender of Last Resort**
This function faces critique:
*   **Moral Hazard:** May encourage excessive risk-taking by banks (e.g., reduced liquidity holdings) knowing central bank support exists, despite repayment terms and conditionalities.
*   **Regulatory Capture:** Risk that regulators, often former industry insiders, may unduly favor institutions under their supervision (e.g., easing terms or conditions).
*   **Fairness Concerns:** The perceived special treatment of bank creditors and depositors (despite deposit insurance like the UK's Â£75k limit) raises questions about why banks receive emergency liquidity unavailable to other failing firms.
