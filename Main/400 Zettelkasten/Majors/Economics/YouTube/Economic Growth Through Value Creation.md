Economic Growth Defined**
True economic growth occurs when value is added to the economy through the creation of goods and services, not through an increase in the money supply.

**The Village Example**
A village butcher, cutler, stone mason, blacksmith, and miner demonstrate this. The butcher pays $100 to the cutler for knives. The cutler pays the same $100 to the stone mason for a grindstone. The stone mason pays it to the blacksmith for a chisel. The blacksmith pays it to the miner for iron ore. Finally, the miner pays the $100 back to the butcher for steak. The money returns to the butcher, yet everyone now possesses a new tool or product.

**Money's Role**
Money is merely a convenient medium of exchange, acting like an IOU passed from person to person. Its presence or circulation doesn't create actual value. Prices and wages rising due to more money in circulation represent only numerical changes, not real economic growth.

**The Value of Trade**
The economy grew because the butcher received knives, the cutler a grindstone, the mason a chisel, the blacksmith iron ore, and the miner steak â€“ tangible goods and services created and exchanged. This trading of products and services is what drives economic growth.

**Policy Implications**
Economic growth is fostered by facilitating more avenues of trade and making it easier to employ people, not by restricting activities based on bureaucratic or political preferences. While politicians may intend well, their interventions often hinder these natural growth processes.
