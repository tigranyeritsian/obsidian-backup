China's Low Domestic Consumption**
Chinese citizens save over 40% of income versus US levels below 10%. Only 38% of China's GDP comes from consumer spending, significantly lower than the US (70%) and global average (56%) due to weak social safety nets like healthcare and the one-child policy, creating heavy old-age dependency burdens.

**Reasons for High Savings**
High saving rates stem from historical trauma (famines), inadequate healthcare (high out-of-pocket costs), and the one-child policy (4:1 support ratio). Investment opportunities for wealth creation are limited compared to the West, where stock ownership and retirement plans fuel the "wealth effect" and spending.

**Infrastructure-Led Growth Model**
To meet government growth targets (e.g., 5%), China relied heavily on construction: tripling road length, building entire US-equivalents of bridges and housing units. This artificial GDP growth occurs regardless of actual use, leading to ghost cities and infrastructure overcapacity.

**Incentive Problem}
Construction is prioritized because it artificially inflates GDP figures, rewarding provincial leaders. Building unused infrastructure (ghost cities, "bridges to nowhere") provides short-term growth metrics but masks unproductive activity, as noted by China Beige Book.

**Export Reliance & Global Tensions**
China's low consumption makes it overly dependent on exports. International demand is waning due to tariffs (e.g., India, US) and other countries' protectionism of key industries (e.g., German autos). This creates global tensions as expected consumer market growth hasn't materialized.

**Solution: Boosting Household Spending**
Balancing trade and sustaining growth requires significantly increasing consumer spending, moving from 38% to nearer global norms (e.g., 48%). Necessary reforms include shifting assets to households/ private sector, strengthening the social safety net, and increasing currency value â€“ changes opposed by the current state-controlled model.
