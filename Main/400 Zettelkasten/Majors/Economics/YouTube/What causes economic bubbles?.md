- **What is a Bubble?** An economic bubble occurs when the price of an asset rises significantly above its intrinsic worth, only to then abruptly plummet.

- **Tulip Mania Example:**
    
    - In the 1630s, during the Dutch Golden Age, tulips became highly sought after in the Netherlands due to their exotic nature and difficulty in growing.
    - A tulip breaking virus made certain flowers even more beautiful and scarce, driving up their prices and popularity.
    - This led to "tulip mania," where people were willing to pay exorbitant sums for tulips, far exceeding their actual value. At one point, a single tulip bulb sold for more than ten times a skilled craftsman's annual salary.

- **Dot-Com Mania Example:** Similar to tulips, stocks in new internet companies during the 1990s were in high demand, with prices driven up by investor hype beyond their intrinsic value.

- **How Bubbles Form:**
    
    - Increased demand for an asset drives up its price.
    - This can create a feedback loop where investors get caught up in the excitement, pushing prices even higher.
    - The price becomes detached from the asset's true worth, forming a bubble.

- **How Bubbles Burst:** A bubble bursts when there's a collective realization that the asset's price far exceeds its worth, leading to a sudden drop in demand and a market crash.

- **Modern Relevance:** Understanding historical bubbles like Tulip Mania helps economists study and potentially avoid future bubbles, such as the real estate bubble of the late 2000s.
