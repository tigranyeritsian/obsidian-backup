The Game of Life**  
Life is an ongoing, complex game where death marks its end. Choices create chains of situations, and optimal strategies often exist theoretically.  

**Game Theory Basics**  
Game theory reduces choices to mathematical formulas for optimal decisions. It assumes rational actors但 ignores human factors like emotion and convention.  

**Prisoner's Dilemma**  
In scenarios like Golden Balls, stealing is the mathematically rational choice (Nash equilibrium), leading to mutual loss if both choose rationally.  

**Kidnapping Dilemma**  
Theory dictates eliminating the hostage to guarantee freedom over a 50% chance of imprisonment, ignoring moral conflicts.  

**Human Biases and Conventions**  
Humans exhibit biases (e.g., preferring heads in coin flips) and follow social conventions (driving rules, tipping), which game theory can exploit but also preserves order.  

**Games of Uncertainty**  
In games like dueling or poker, optimal strategies often involve randomness or calculated bluffs, as pure rationality fails against unpredictable human behavior.  

**Ultimatum Game**  
Game theory predicts unfair splits (99:1) should be accepted. However, human spite causes rejection of perceived unfair offers, leading to mutual loss. Repetition fosters more equitable outcomes.  

**Repeated Interactions: Tit for Tat**  
Repeated prisoner's dilemmas favor cooperative strategies. The "Tit for Tat" approach—start cooperative, mirror the opponent's last move—proves most effective due to its niceness, retaliation, forgiveness, and clarity.  

**Life Application**  
Life resembles repeated games. Optimal strategies combine Tit for Tat principles with adaptability, intuition, and occasional randomness to maximize outcomes in an unfair system.
