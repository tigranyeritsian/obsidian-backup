Here's a list of strategies discussed in the video "Make the Other Feel Guilty â€“ Machiavelli and the Art of Disguised Obedience," focusing on how guilt is leveraged for control:

- **Subtle Implantation of Guilt:** Instead of overt force or fear, the video emphasizes the strategy of subtly planting "seeds of guilt" to gain obedience. This makes individuals feel they are acting out of their own choice.

- **Creating Emotional Debt:** This strategy involves providing benefits or acting in ways that make others feel indebted, thereby creating an "emotional debt" that can be repaid through obedience. Julius Caesar's distribution of free food and public festivities is cited as an example.

- **Framing Dissent as Betrayal:** Leaders can manipulate guilt by framing any hesitation, disagreement, or lack of compliance as a betrayal of a greater cause, country, or shared ideal. Napoleon Bonaparte's use of duty and sacrifice to motivate his soldiers exemplifies this.

- **Systematic Guilt Instillation:** This involves creating a pervasive culture where individuals are made to feel guilty, even when innocent, often through constant scrutiny, accusations, or the threat of exposure. Joseph Stalin's purges of the 1930s are presented as an extreme example of this "industrial level" guilt manipulation.

- **Exploiting Internalized Norms (Superego Manipulation):** The strategy leverages the psychological aspect of guilt as a conditioned response, appealing to an individual's internalized social and moral norms (the superego). By making actions seem to violate these norms, guilt is triggered.

- **Creating Competitive and High-Pressure Environments:** In modern contexts, this involves establishing cultures where failure is seen as a personal or moral failing, leading to self-imposed guilt. The video mentions figures like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk creating competitive work cultures that foster this.

- **Presenting "Choices" that Lead to Guilt:** Manipulators can present situations where any choice made, other than the desired one, will inevitably lead to feelings of guilt or regret, thus subtly guiding behavior.

- **Shifting Blame and Responsibility:** A strategy to make others feel guilty is to subtly or directly shift blame onto them, even if the situation is not their fault, thereby burdening them with the feeling of responsibility and guilt.

These strategies collectively highlight the "art of disguised obedience," where individuals are led to comply not through explicit commands, but through the powerful, often unseen, influence of guilt.
