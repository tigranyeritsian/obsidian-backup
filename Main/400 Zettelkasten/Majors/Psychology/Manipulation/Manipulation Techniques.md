### 1. **Negging**

Negging is a subtle but harmful form of **emotional manipulation**. It usually comes across as a “backhanded compliment” (e.g., “You’re smart for someone who never finished college” or “You look good today, I didn’t expect that”). The core goal isn’t humor—it’s to **undermine confidence**.

- **Why it’s used:** The manipulator wants to destabilize your self-esteem so you begin to seek their approval. When someone feels uncertain about their worth, they often cling to whoever provides validation—even if that person is the one causing the insecurity.
    
- **Underlying psychology:** This comes from insecurity and fear of inadequacy in the manipulator. They can’t compete openly, so they level the field by cutting others down.
    
- **Effects:** The victim may second-guess themselves, crave reassurance, and unconsciously put the manipulator in a position of power.

### 2. **Belittling someone**

Belittling is a more direct attack. It can appear in **spreading false rumors, gossiping, dismissive comments, or accusations of inadequacy**. Unlike negging, which hides under a layer of subtlety, belittling is openly meant to **shame, humiliate, or devalue**.

- **Why it’s used:** The manipulator tries to maintain dominance in a social or personal context by lowering your social image or credibility.
    
- **Examples:** A coworker constantly saying “You’re not cut out for this project,” or an ex spreading rumors about your character.
    
- **Psychological roots:** Projection of their own insecurities; instead of facing their flaws, they displace them onto you.
    
- **Effects:** Creates self-doubt, damages reputation, and can isolate you socially.

### 3. **Focusing on your flaws more than your strengths**

Some people have a fragile **ego identity**. They feel threatened by others’ talents, intelligence, or achievements. To protect themselves, they **ignore or downplay your strengths** while amplifying your weaknesses.

- **Why it’s used:** By magnifying your flaws, they maintain the illusion of superiority. If they acknowledged your strengths, they’d feel small, powerless, or dependent.
    
- **Examples:** A partner only pointing out your mistakes in arguments but never acknowledging your successes. A parent who criticizes your career path instead of celebrating your progress.
    
- **Effects:** Over time, you might internalize this negativity, believing you’re defined more by shortcomings than capabilities. This keeps you from fully realizing your potential and keeps you under their psychological control.

### 4. **Setting others up against you**

This is a classic manipulation strategy known as **triangulation**. The manipulator enlists others to reinforce their narrative, creating a **group bias** against you.

- **Why it’s used:** If they’ve been rejected, embarrassed, or hurt by you, they seek to regain control by controlling others’ perception of you. They weaponize social pressure and collective judgment.
    
- **Example:** After a breakup, an ex spreads lies so that their friends hate you. This way, you’re punished socially while they regain validation and sympathy.
    
- **Psychological roots:** Fear of abandonment, rejection, or loss of control. They cannot cope with powerlessness, so they rebuild power by turning people into allies against you.
    
- **Effects:** Can severely harm reputation, cause social isolation, and create hostility in communities (workplace, friend groups, even family). It’s often experienced as betrayal because the manipulator attacks your support network.

### 5. **A commitment to misunderstand you**

This happens when resentment, jealousy, or unresolved anger clouds someone’s perception so deeply that they **refuse to see your intentions accurately**.

- **Why it’s used:** By twisting your words or misinterpreting actions, they keep themselves in the role of victim and you in the role of “wrongdoer.” This sustains their ego’s need for moral superiority.
    
- **Examples:** You make a neutral comment, and they insist you meant it as an insult. You try to clarify, and they accuse you of “gaslighting” them. They aren’t misunderstanding by accident—it’s **deliberate distortion**.
    
- **Psychological roots:** Deep-seated resentment, unresolved trauma, or narcissistic tendencies. For some, seeing you correctly would mean losing the justification for their anger, and that threatens their ego.
    
- **Effects:** Communication breakdown, cycles of conflict, and emotional exhaustion. Victims may feel trapped, as no matter how they explain themselves, they’re always “wrong.”


## How to respond:

1. Negging — Although many use this for light banter in dating, some abusers use this a lot to gaslight you. When it happens, separate your sense of self-worth from the opinion they have of you and don’t take it personally. Always remember that what other people say and do is primarily about themselves. Not you.

2. Getting belittled — people spread gossip because they are bored and have not much going on in their lives. Don’t take it personally and remind yourself that you know your truth. You know all the facts and the truth always comes out one way or another.

If possible, get out of such toxic environments.

3. Pointing out your flaws more than your strengths — if they are passive aggressive and arrogant about it, don’t take it personally. Don’t react with anger and absolutely do not give in to their gaslighting because some people loft themselves up by pulling others down.

If they are kind about it and it only happened once then do consider if that 'flaw' really requires your attention and affects all other areas of your life negatively.

4. Setting others up against you — Just move on and don’t look back. Some people have a really fragile ego or really low self-esteem and don’t handle rejection or envy so well.

Life and the truth will take care of them and eventually, they will grow up at some point.

5. Being committed to misunderstand you — Don’t bother interacting with such people for they are not part of your 'tribe‘. Remember that you cannot win arguments with idiots and ignorant people.
