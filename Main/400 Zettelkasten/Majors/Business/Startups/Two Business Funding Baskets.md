## Two Business Funding Baskets
Startups fall into two funding categories: explosive growth businesses seeking acquisition or IPO (attracting venture capital), and lifestyle businesses prioritizing ownership and control (not suitable for VC funding). This summary focuses on explosive growth venture capital funding.

## Funding Rounds and Milestones
Funding occurs in stages aligned with company development:
- **Pre-Seed**: Validates team capability to build a product.
- **Seed**: Requires launched product and initial customer traction; funds faster replication of growth tactics.
- **Series A**: Requires over $1M annual revenue; focuses on proving sustainable growth model and unit economics.
- **Series B**: Targets $10M+ revenue; critical for demonstrating scalable market domination strategy and potential exit paths. Pitch decks change fundamentally across rounds (team -> traction -> financial metrics & market dominance).

## Valuation Mechanics
Startup valuation is fundamentally an agreement on risk/reward, not a precise science:
- Pre-money valuation = company value before investment.
- Post-money valuation = pre-money + investment amount.
- Example: $500k investment for 10% implies $5M post-money ($4.5M pre-money).
- Pre-seed standard valuations are typically $3M-$5M. Seed/Series+ valuations increasingly consider revenue multiples or growth potential.

## Dilution Explained
Venture capital investment primarily involves the company issuing *new shares* to investors:
- Founders' existing share count stays constant, but the *total* shares increase.
- Founders' percentage ownership decreases (dilution) as new investors receive shares.
- By Series B, founders typically lose majority control (<50% ownership).

## Critical Survival Tactics
- **Runway is Key**: Raised funds must precisely cover costs to reach the *next fundable milestone*. Running out of money between rounds (a common failure mode) is fatal.
- **Accurate Budgeting**: Essential for calculating required runway. Mistakes here are dangerous.
- **Convertible Notes**: A common instrument (especially pre-seed/seed) to defer complex valuation negotiations and legal setup until later rounds.
- **Target Appropriate Investors**: Focus efforts on investors specializing in your specific company stage.
