### **Step 1: Research & Understand Your Audience**

Value creation begins with truly knowing your customers — their **dream outcomes**, needs, pain points, and the barriers keeping them from achieving their goals. Conduct interviews, run surveys, observe behavior, and engage in direct conversations. Study specific segments and build detailed customer personas. When you align your offering with what they genuinely want, you’re no longer guessing — you’re delivering precision.

> Customers want to get their purchase right the first time. This requires anticipating not only current desires but also future preferences.

### **Step 2: Spot Gaps in the Market**

Look at what your competitors are doing — and more importantly, where they fall short. Identify opportunities they’re missing. As Austin Kleon suggests, “Copy your heroes. Examine where you fall short… That’s what you should amplify.” By recognizing unmet needs or underwhelming experiences in your market, you can position yourself as the solution that truly delivers.

> Gaps in the market are also opportunities for differentiation. This is where innovation and relevance are born.

---

### **Step 3: Craft Unique Selling Propositions (USPs)**

Your USP is what makes your offering stand out. It’s the answer to: _Why should a customer choose you over anyone else?_ This must be specific, bold, and clear. Don’t be afraid to “zag when others zig.” A powerful USP not only attracts attention but also solidifies your competitive advantage.

> A strong USP reflects your values, serves a niche, and creates emotional and functional value.

### **Step 4: Constantly Gather Feedback**

Value creation is not static. Markets shift, customer preferences evolve, and technology transforms expectations. Stay in constant contact with your audience through polls, reviews, open conversations, and direct questions. Don’t just ask for feedback — ask for advice. Let customers become collaborators. This not only builds loyalty but helps you stay ahead of trends.

> Sustained customer satisfaction requires constant listening and improvement.

---

### **Step 5: Iterate and Improve**

The only constant in business is change. Keep refining your product, messaging, systems, and customer experience. Innovation — whether in features, processes, or delivery — is key to long-term value. The companies that succeed are not the ones that never fail, but the ones that never stop adapting.

> Blackberry became obsolete not because of poor quality, but because it stopped innovating while others raced ahead.

### **Why Value Creation Matters**

1. **Sustainable Business Success**  
    Clear value creation aligns your initiatives with long-term goals. When resources are used purposefully and customer needs are well-understood, your company is more resilient — even in times of uncertainty.
    
2. **Customer Satisfaction**  
    Value begins before the sale and continues long after. A satisfied customer is not only more loyal but also becomes a source of referrals and brand advocacy.
    
3. **Competitive Advantage**  
    Businesses that lead with value stay top-of-mind and top-of-market. During disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic, companies with clear, differentiated value often survived and thrived.
    
4. **Stakeholder Engagement**  
    Internally, value creation involves transparency with stakeholders. Clear communication about performance, goals, and direction keeps everyone aligned and focused.
    
5. **Financial Performance**  
    Meeting customer and stakeholder needs leads to more precise pricing strategies, optimized profit margins, and better resource allocation.
    
6. **Innovation and Adaptability**  
    Businesses that continuously innovate retain existing customers and attract new ones. Being proactive ensures you're not playing catch-up when the market shifts.
    
7. **Operational Efficiency**  
    Value creation also applies internally. Streamlining operations (e.g., with automation) can improve productivity and free up resources for higher-impact work.
    
8. **Differentiation**  
    Your vision, guided by a value-based strategy, helps you stand out. Customers recognize and reward businesses that clearly articulate how they meet specific needs better than the rest.
    
9. **Social and Environmental Responsibility**  
    Today’s customers value honesty and sustainability. Real, transparent actions — not greenwashing — can build trust and strengthen your brand’s reputation.

### **Real-world Examples**:

1. **Write an article for one person:** Create content that speaks directly to your audience’s problems and challenges. Much like I have done with this newsletter.
2. **Value-driven Initiatives**: Create a mini-course, email sequence, ebook, podcast, workshop, webinar or challenge that helps your ideal client get one step closer to their dream outcome in less time and less effort. _E.g.: A 1-day guide on crafting a unique CV._
3. **Personalised Recommendations**: Send an article, book or podcast to a prospective client that speaks directly to a challenge they have shared.
4. **Building Bridges**: Connect two people you feel should meet. You’ll never be forgotten
5. **Tailored Coaching**: Offer complimentary sessions tailored to potential clients. _E.g.: Career Audit, Business Strategy Session, Quarterly Planning, etc._
6. **Constructive Feedback**: Share a video critique of someone’s LinkedIn or blog, especially beneficial for business coaches.
7. **Go Live**: Run live sessions on topics your audience grapples with.
8. **Inspire**: Inspire your audience with vulnerability, story and courage. Live the transformation of coaching.
9. Awe your audience with your loving presence, compassion and listening.
10. **Appreciate and Amplify**: Acknowledge people. Share their work. Celebrate them. Cheer them on. Be a beacon of hope and positivity.
11. **Community Creation**: Bring people together. Create a free group. Whatsapp/Telegram/Facebook group.
12. **Combine Clients and Prospects:** Put your potential and current clients in a room together. Let your clients spontaneously speak about the impact of your coaching.
13. **Innovative Offers**: Create new offers or programs. If you are constantly hearing “no” you need to get more creative. Business is easy if listen to customers, look at data, try stuff and remain prolific.

### **Current clients**:

1. **Surprise and delight:** Send random meaningful gifts. For a client’s recent 40th, I sent him a copy of The Telegraph from the day he was born. Out of all his presents that day, mine stood out.
2. **Unwavering Faith**: Believe in your clients more than they believe in themselves.
3. **Deep Connections**: See, feel and hear your clients like no one else has in their life.
4. **Draw Out Truth:** Say what no one else would dare to say. Be the person in their life that draws out their truth.
5. **Generous Sessions**: Offer bonus sessions. Run a double length session. For example I once offered a client a bonus session, and just said, “Tell me your story…”
6. **Client-centric Content**: Write an article for a client’s specific challenge. *Remember to share it with them.
7. **Check-ins**: Show your clients how much you care and listen. Surprise them with calls or messages between sessions, checking on specific things they have shared with you. _“How did your interview go with…?”_
8. **Stretch Their Limits**: Challenge your clients thinking. I once pressed a client to condense a 10-year vision into 6 months, leading to a pivotal business insight.
9. **Serve Beyond:** Work with people around your clients. I have run sessions with clients and their Executive Assistants — it’s changed their relationship and effectiveness.
10. **Go The Extra Mile:** Delve deep into areas affecting your clients. When one client struggled with jet lag, I not only developed a travel protocol but also involved his EA.
11. **Client Get-togethers**: Connect your clients. Bring your clients together for a lunch or something fun.
12. **Continual Growth**: Walk the walk by hiring the best coaches your money can afford. Share your own learnings, insights and stories with your clients. Never stop growing. Always be ahead.
13. **Simplify:** Take complex challenges your clients are having and simplify them.
14. **Cheer and Celebrate**: Celebrate your clients. Most people lack cheerleaders. Be that for your clients, helping them revel in their successes.
