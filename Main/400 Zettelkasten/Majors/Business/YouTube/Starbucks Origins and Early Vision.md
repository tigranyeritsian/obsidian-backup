Starbucks Origins and Early Vision**  
Howard Schultz joined Starbucks in 1982 as head of marketing, inspired by Italian coffee culture while visiting Milan. He envisioned Starbucks as a "third place" beyond home and work, focusing on community and experience, not just coffee beans. The founders initially resisted serving drinks, Schultz persisted, and opened the first coffee bar in 1983.

**Acquisition and Rapid Expansion**  
Schultz bought Starbucks for $3.8 million in 1987 after a pivotal moment where Bill Gates Sr. intervened to block a hostile takeover. Post-acquisition, he transformed it into a beverage-focused retailer. By 1992, Starbucks went public with $93M revenue and $250M market cap. Key tactics included strategic market-by-market expansion, iconic branding via the cup, and avoiding franchising to control culture.

**Global Growth and Cultural Adaptation**  
Starbucks expanded internationally beginning with Japan in 1996, later China and beyond. Local adaptation was critical—like customizing menus in China (driven by Belinda Wong) and entering Italy only with premium Roastery stores. Partnerships (e.g., Nestlé, PepsiCo for Frappuccino) and acquisition of The Coffee Connection boosted scale.

**Business Model and Innovations**  
Starbucks combined high-margin beverages (80% gross margin) with repeat customer frequency ("lightning in a bottle"). Innovations included mobile ordering/pay (33% of orders), which drove growth but later challenged experiential integrity. The "pay it forward" float model yielded $1.7B in gift card float annually. Customization created 100,+ drink variations.

**People-Centric Culture and Challenges**  
Employee benefits (healthcare for part-timers, Bean Stock equity grants) reduced turnover. Schultz emphasized humanity and servant leadership, but founder succession issues emerged. Recent struggles include declining same-store sales, unionization, and mobile-ordering over-saturation diluting the "third place" experience.

**Current State and Schultz's Advice**  
Starbucks operates 39,000 stores across 86 countries (18% in China, generating 36B revenue). Schultz warns against prioritizing transactions over experience and advocates for coffee-forward simplicity. Post-pandemic challenges include execution missteps and over-reliance on digital.
