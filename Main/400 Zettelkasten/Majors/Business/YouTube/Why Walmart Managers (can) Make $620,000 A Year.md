## Main Argument

Walmart has effectively created centrally planned economies within a capitalist framework — achieving what socialist economies aimed for, but through market dominance rather than state control.

## Origins & Philosophy

Sam Walton, born in 1918, grew up during the Great Depression and believed in community-based, frugal business.  
He started with Ben Franklin variety stores, learning retail fundamentals before opening the first Walmart in 1962 in Arkansas.  
His early strategy focused on low prices, local focus, and American-made goods — all aimed at building community loyalty.

## Business Model Evolution

Walmart introduced EDLP (Everyday Low Prices), undercutting rivals by:

- Buying in bulk
- Building massive distribution networks
- Squeezing suppliers for lower costs  
    Innovations like cross-docking and AI-driven logistics let Walmart avoid long-term storage and better predict demand — mimicking a planned economy without traditional markets.

## Irony: Capitalism Imitating Socialism

Walmart's model mirrors socialist central planning: it dictates supply and demand at scale, but does so efficiently via data and logistics rather than bureaucracy.  
It has become a monopsony (sole buyer) in many areas — dominating both supply chains and local labor markets.  
Critics argue this undermines the core idea of free-market capitalism, where competition determines prices and supply.

## The “Walmart Effect”

When Walmart enters a town:

1. Small businesses collapse due to price competition.
2. Communities become dependent on Walmart for jobs and goods.
3. Walmart can then lower wages, resist unions, and centralize control.  
    Employees report high stress, low pay, and cult-like environments.
    
## Influence & Politics

Walmart is one of the largest employers in the world.  
It uses political lobbying (over $73 million spent between 2010 and 2020) to influence laws, prevent regulations, and gain favorable treatment.  
It has massive sway over trade policy, environmental rules, and global labor standards — all in the name of cheap prices.

## International Failures

Walmart struggled in Germany and the UK due to:

- Cultural misunderstandings (e.g., morning cheer routines)
- Strong local competitors (Tesco, Lidl, Aldi)
- Urban density and low car use, which made large stores impractical  
    The result was billions lost and eventual exit from markets like Germany and the sale of its stake in Asda (UK).
    
## Conclusion

Walmart succeeded where communism failed: efficient centralized planning under capitalism.  
It redefined what corporate power can look like — too big to fail, too integrated to resist.  
Both capitalists and socialists have reasons to fear or admire it:

- Capitalists because it's crushing market competition
- Socialists because it shows central planning can work — but at the cost of worker exploitation and community dependence
