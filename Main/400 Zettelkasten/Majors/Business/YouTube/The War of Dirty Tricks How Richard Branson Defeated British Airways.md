## Origins of Virgin Atlantic

- In 1978, Branson was stranded in Puerto Rico when his flight was canceled. He chartered a plane, sold seats to other stranded passengers for $39 each, and received a comment suggesting he could succeed in the airline business.
- Motivated by poor service in the airline industry, Branson envisioned an airline that combined fun with business. He leased a used Boeing 747 with a clever deal allowing him to return it if the business failed.

## Conflict with British Airways

- Despite starting with just one plane (vs. British Airways' 300+), Virgin Atlantic grew rapidly and began threatening BA's monopoly at Heathrow Airport.
- BA's chairman Lord John King dismissed Branson as "too old to rock'n roll, and too young to fly" but later viewed Virgin as a serious threat.

## The "Dirty Tricks Campaign"

- British Airways launched an unethical campaign against Virgin, including:
    - Intercepting Virgin's reservations and falsely telling passengers their flights were canceled
    - Hiring private investigators to spy on Branson and dig through his trash
    - Leaking false rumors about Virgin's financial instability to the press

## Branson's Response

- When BA's libelous attacks became provable, Branson faced a difficult choice: sell his profitable Virgin Records to fund a lawsuit or risk bankruptcy.
- He sold Virgin Records to EMI for nearly $1 billion in 1992 to finance the legal battle.

## Legal Victory

- In 1993, Branson sued British Airways for libel and won the largest libel settlement in UK history (£610,000 plus £3 million legal fees).
- BA was forced to publicly apologize, and Lord King resigned in disgrace.
- Branson distributed the settlement money to Virgin staff as a "BA Christmas Bonus."

## Key Takeaways

The story demonstrates how an underdog can challenge industry giants through innovation and integrity. Branson's success came from:

- Turning personal frustration into business opportunity
- Creating a customer-focused airline experience
- Persisting despite unethical competition
- Making difficult sacrifices to fight for justice

The video concludes by promoting Dashlane (password management software) and announcing a giveaway of a signed Richard Branson photo.
