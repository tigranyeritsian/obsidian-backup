TSMC: The Unseen Pillar of Global Technology**  

**Introduction & Background**  
TSMC, founded in 1987 by Morris Chang, is the world's largest dedicated semiconductor foundry. Remastered in 2025, this episode details its origin story, rise to dominance, and critical role in modern technology. Despite minimal public recognition, TSMC produces chips for Apple, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, AMD, and hyperscalers like AWS and Microsoft, powering smartphones, AI, and military applications. Its market cap has doubled since 2021, exceeding $1 trillion, making it a geopolitical outlier as one of only two non-West Coast companies in the global top ten.  

**Founding & Morris Chang**  
Chang, born in 1931 China, navigated war and emigrated to the US in 1949. After failing PhD exams at Stanford, he joined Texas Instruments (TI), where he revolutionized semiconductor yields and developed "learning curve pricing." Passed over for TI CEO due to cultural and political barriers, he left Texas Instruments and later General Instrument before being recruited to Taiwan’s Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). In 1987, under government pressure, Chang founded TSMC as a pure-play foundry, despite skepticism from industry giants like Intel and TI. His vision: enable chip designers by outsourcing complex, capital-intensive manufacturing.  

**Business Model Transformation**  
TSMC disrupted the "real men have fabs" model by offering contract manufacturing. Initially reliant on capacity deals from IDMs (Integrated Device Manufacturers), it survived early struggles by betting on the rise of fabless companies (e.g., NVIDIA, Qualcomm). TSMC’s flywheel effect—growing revenue → higher margins → Reinvestment in R&D and advanced fabs—drove exponential growth. By 2023, it commanded 90% of the 5nm market and dominated cutting-edge chips, while competitors like Samsung dwindled.  

**Technological Leadership**  
TSMC’s prowess stems from process power, accumulated over 40 years. Manufacturing chips requires arguably the world’s most advanced science—combining chemistry, physics, and mathematics. Lithography breakthroughs, like ASML’s EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) machines, are critical. EUV involves vaporizing tin droplets 50,000 times/second to etch circuits smaller than light wavelengths, costing $200M+ per machine. TSMC’s ability to master and integrate these technologies creates an insurmountable moat.  

**Global Impact & Geopolitical Risks**  
TSMC controls 50% of the foundry market and ~95% of profits. Its chips are ubiquitous: in iPhones, AI accelerators, cars, and fighter jets. However, its location in Taiwan—a geopolitical hotspot—poses existential risk. US and China vie for semiconductor sovereignty, with TSMC expanding diversification (e.g., Arizona and Japan fabs) to mitigate tensions. A Taiwan conflict would halt global tech advancement, highlighting its critical-but-vulnerable role.  

**Market Position & Financials**  
TSMC operates at ~40% margins, fueled by high-value contracts. It raises prices amid unprecedented demand, with $30B+ annual capex—$30B in 2024 alone. Revenue grew 31% in 2020, and its 2021 capex exceeds $28B. Compound annual revenue growth stands at 17.4% since 1994, with a 19.9% IRR over 27 years. It leads Moore’s Law scaling, advancing from 7nm to 3nm processes, though physical limits near.  

**Future Challenges**  
TSMC faces threats from paradigm shifts (e.g., quantum computing), US-China decoupling, and Intel’s resurgence as a foundry. Yet its moat remains deep: replicating its IP, ecosystem, and process power is near-impossible without decades of iteration. Despite geopolitical risks and technological evolution, TSMC’s flywheel and control of the most profitable market segments secure its dominance.
