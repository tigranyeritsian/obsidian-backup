This video explains that some skills are difficult to learn because their components are interdependent, unlike simple skills such as brewing tea which involve discrete, separately practiceable steps. An example of a complex skill given is playing Starcraft, where various actions like resource collection, building, scouting, attacking, and defending all rely on each other.

The video suggests that a simple yet effective way to learn such interdependent skills is to change what you pay attention to. This concept is illustrated by a study involving a game called "Space Fortress."

Here's how the Space Fortress study was conducted and its findings:

    Participants Learners were divided into four groups.

    Practice Structure All groups played the game for 6.5 hours over 10 sessions.

    Group 1 (Control) Played the game without specific instructions on what to focus on.

    Group 2 Instructed to focus on ship controls for the first six sessions, then played normally.

    Group 3 Instructed to focus on mine placement for the first six sessions, then played normally.

    Group 4 Instructed to focus on ship control for the first three sessions, then mine placement for the next three sessions, and then played normally.

Results after six sessions:

    Control group: ~1000 points.

    Groups focusing on one aspect (Group 2 & 3): ~1500 points.

    Group focusing on two different aspects sequentially (Group 4): ~2000 points.

Even after all groups played normally for the final four sessions, Group 4 continued to show greater learning gains. **The video concludes that focusing on one aspect of a skill at a time helps the brain create meaningful building blocks, allowing for better integration of complex skills over time. The advice given is to sequentially focus on different aspects of a complex skill rather than trying to pay attention to everything simultaneously.**
