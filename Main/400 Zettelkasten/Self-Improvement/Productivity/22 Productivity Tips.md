#### **Key Themes:**

1. **Productivity ≠ Busyness** – It’s about doing what moves you toward your goals, not just filling time.
2. **Work with Your Brain** – Don’t expect perfection; plan for distractions and energy dips.
3. **Sustainability > Intensity** – Small, consistent improvements beat short bursts of unsustainable effort.

### **Top 22 Tips:**

1. **Don’t Trust Your Brain**
    - Your brain seeks shortcuts, not productivity. Plan for failures (e.g., schedule breaks to avoid burnout).

2. **Start Small, Then Go Nuclear**
    - Fix easy problems first. If they persist, eliminate them entirely (e.g., delete distracting apps).

3. **Follow "Sue’s Law" (Go Where the Money Is)**
    - Focus on the 1–2 changes that would _double_ your productivity (e.g., reducing procrastination).

4. **Do More with Less**
    - Simplify tools/systems. Fewer apps = fewer points of failure.

5. **Prioritize Deep Flow**
    - Multitasking is a myth. Single-task focus yields the best results.

6. **Find Your Flow Times**
    - Identify when you’re most focused (e.g., mornings) and guard that time.

7. **Use a Distraction Cheat Sheet**
    - Write down distractions as they happen to address them later.

8. **Create Focus Zones**
    - Designate physical/mental spaces for deep work (e.g., cafes with noise-canceling headphones).

9. **Use Work-Rest Timers (But Flexibly)**
    - Adjust timers to your natural focus spans (e.g., 90-minute blocks vs. rigid 25-minute Pomodoros).

10. **Hire the "Babysitter"**
    - Protect your time proactively (e.g., add transition rituals like a walk before work).

11. **Plan for the _Real_ (Not the Ideal)**
    - Track actual time spent on tasks to set realistic schedules.

12. **The "Or Not" Framework**
    - Before adding a new task, ask: _What will I drop to make room?_

13. **2-Minute Rule**
    - Do tiny tasks immediately (e.g., quick emails) instead of scheduling them.

14. **"Book the Scan" Early**
    - Delegate or send requests ASAP to avoid future bottlenecks.

15. **Batch Tasks**
    - Group small, similar tasks (e.g., admin work) into dedicated blocks.

16. **Eat the Frog**
    - Tackle the hardest task first to avoid procrastination.

17. **Leave Tasks Unfinished**
    - Leverage the **Zeigarnik Effect**: Starting a task primes your brain to finish it later.

18. **Delete Decision Fatigue**
    - Pre-plan choices (e.g., weekly meal prep) to conserve mental energy.

19. **Stay on the Pulse**
    - Adjust schedules based on how quickly priorities shift (e.g., check critical updates hourly).

20. **Time Blocking vs. Time Boxing**
    - **Blocking**: Flexible time chunks. **Boxing**: Fixed deadlines (good for long-term goals).

21. **Urgent ≠ Important**
    - Use the **Eisenhower Matrix** to prioritize tasks with long-term impact (e.g., learning a skill).

22. **Sharpen the Axe**
    - Invest time in improving systems (e.g., learning efficient study techniques) to save time later.

### **Final Advice:**

- **"Productivity is not about being busy—it’s about doing what gets you closer to your goals."**
- **Experiment and personalize**—what works for others may not work for you.
- **Protect time for important-but-not-urgent tasks** (e.g., skill-building) to avoid future regret.
