This article outlines the daily routine of Jacob, a freelance designer who follows specific habits to maximize his brain power and productivity. The core principle is the "90-minute rule" - working in focused 90-minute blocks that align with the brain's natural ultradian rhythms.

## Key Habits for Optimal Brain Function

### The 90-Minute Focus Rule

- Works in 90-minute focused sessions followed by 15-minute breaks
- Aligns with brain's natural ultradian rhythms for peak alertness and creativity
- Allows Jacob to accomplish more by noon than he previously did in a full day

### Morning Routine

- **Silent mornings**: Starts day in complete silence to allow prefrontal cortex to activate without distraction
- **Sunlight exposure**: Gets natural light within 30 minutes of waking to regulate circadian rhythm
- **Vision reminder**: Keeps his long-term goal visible to direct brain's reward system

### Physical Health Habits

- **Morning walk**: Takes 20-minute walks to activate brain's default mode network for creativity
- **Light movement**: Does gentle exercise (yoga, slow biking) to boost BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor)
- **Cold showers**: Uses cold exposure to activate norepinephrine for alertness and build resilience
- **Strength training**: Does focused resistance training twice weekly to build mental discipline
- **Power naps**: Takes 20-minute naps when focus wavers to recharge brain function

### Nutrition and Mental Health

- **Brain food**: Eats foods that support neurotransmitters (salmon, blueberries, dark chocolate)
- **Mindful eating**: Eats without screens to give brain proper nutrients and presence
- **Digital fast**: Disconnects from technology mid-afternoon to rewire brain to enjoy stillness
- **Meditation**: Practices 10 minutes of meditation daily to clear mental clutter

### Evening Routine

- **Problem journaling**: Writes about one unsolved problem before bed to prime brain for sleep processing
- **Mental load dump**: Records all tasks and worries before bed to reduce anxiety
- **Gratitude journaling**: Notes three things he's grateful for to rewire brain to notice positives
- **Sleep defense**: Prioritizes 7-9 hours of quality sleep for neurogenesis and memory consolidation

### Learning and Social Habits

- **Curiosity burst**: Takes 5-minute breaks to explore random questions to maintain mental agility
- **Teachback trick**: Explains something learned as if teaching a child to enhance retention
- **Daily win reflection**: Asks what moved him forward to focus on progress over perfection
- **Social interaction**: Makes time for face-to-face connection daily for oxytocin release

The article emphasizes that optimizing brain function comes from implementing multiple small, science-backed habits that work together synergistically rather than relying on a single magic solution.
