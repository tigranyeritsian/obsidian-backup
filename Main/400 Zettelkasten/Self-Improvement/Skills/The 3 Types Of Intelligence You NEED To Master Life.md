## The Triarchic Theory of Intelligence & How to Develop It

This video explains Robert Sternberg's theory that true success requires **three types of intelligence**, using historical examples and practical techniques:

### 1. Practical Intelligence ("Street Smarts")

- **Core Components:** Judgment + Adaptability
- **Example:** Victor Lustig's 1925 Eiffel Tower scam exploited scrap dealer Andre Poisson's lack of judgment and status anxiety.
- **Improving Judgment (Recognize Heuristics):**
    - **Anchoring:** Over-relying on first information (e.g., sales showing expensive items first).
    - **Availability:** Overweighting easily recalled info (e.g., fearing sharks more than cows after news reports).
    - **Representativeness:** Judging based on stereotypes (e.g., assuming tattooed people are dangerous).
    - **Affect:** Letting emotions control judgment (e.g., rating enjoyable activities as safer).
- **Warning Signs of Manipulation:** Unearned compliments, isolation, rushing decisions.
- **Improving Adaptability (Use the OODA Loop):**
    - **Observe:** Analyze the current situation.
    - **Orient:** Determine what it means for you.
    - **Decide:** Choose the best action.
    - **Act:** Execute without hesitation (e.g., Top Gun combat scenario).

### 2. Creative Intelligence

- **Core Concept:** "Steal Like an Artist" - Find inspiration everywhere and add your unique touch.
- **Example:** Japanese engineers solved the bullet train's sonic boom problem by mimicking the kingfisher bird's beak design.
- **Historical Inspiration:** Da Vinci (birds for flight), Morse (art for Morse code).
- **Improvement Strategy:**
    - Actively seek inspiration from diverse fields (art, nature, other domains).
    - **Never just copy; adapt and innovate.** (Alex Hormozi: Learn skills from their origin domain).
- **Bonus Tip:** Creativity spikes when slightly tired (brain forms unexpected connections).

### 3. Analytical Intelligence

- **Core Technique:** First Principles Thinking (used by Musk, Bezos, Buffett).
    - **Step 1: Break Down:** Identify fundamental components (e.g., "A restaurant = kitchen, ingredients, cooks, food delivery").
    - **Step 2: Challenge Assumptions:** Question core beliefs (e.g., "Do people need to dine in?").
    - **Step 3: Rebuild from Scratch:** Create new solutions (e.g., Cloud Kitchens - delivery-only kitchens).
- **Cognitive Training Exercise:** Dual N-Back
    - **How it works:** Remember the location of a visual square _and_ a spoken letter simultaneously across trials.
    - **Why it helps:** Forces holding, updating, and manipulating multiple information streams.
    - **Result:** Studies show 8-19 days of training significantly improves fluid intelligence/problem-solving. (Start with Dual 1-Back).
- **Best Method:** Continuous learning remains fundamental.

**Key Takeaway:** Success requires developing **all three intelligences** – practical savvy, creative innovation, and analytical reasoning – through specific techniques and awareness of cognitive biases.
