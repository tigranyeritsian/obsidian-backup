# 5 Techniques to Improve Articulation Skills

The speaker explains that articulation is not an innate talent but a skill that can be developed. They share five techniques to improve communication abilities:

1. **Embrace silence in conversations**: Take time to think before responding rather than rushing to fill silence. If silence feels awkward, explicitly state you need a moment to think, repeat the question, or think out loud to process ideas together.
    
2. **Develop knowledge before articulating beliefs**: Don't feel pressured to have opinions on everything. Ensure you have a solid understanding of topics before speaking about them. When lacking knowledge, focus on asking questions instead of pretending expertise.
    
3. **Journal for clarity**: Writing helps organize thoughts and improves understanding. The process forces you to slow down and think more clearly about your ideas, which builds confidence when speaking later.
    
4. **Leave room for inner dialogue**: Create quiet moments in your day without constant stimulation (music, podcasts, scrolling). This allows your mind to process information and develop thoughts, forming a stronger foundation for clear speech.
    
5. **Practice by talking to yourself**: Rehearse articulation by speaking aloud when alone. Pretend to give speeches or have conversations, or film yourself to review and improve your speech patterns without fear of judgment.
    
The speaker notes these are personal techniques that worked for them and encourage experimentation to find what works best for each individual.
