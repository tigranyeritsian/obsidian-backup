1. Pick **a clear, high-quality model** (text, lecture, solved example, or problem set).
2. Do one uninterrupted **read/listen/solve-through** to get the overview.
3. Segment the material into **small chunks or problem steps**.
4. Shadow: read/listen/solve one chunk, then immediately **reproduce** it aloud or in writing without looking.
5. Check the original, **note errors and gaps**, **correct** them.
6. **Repeat** shadowing for the whole piece until you can reproduce the reasoning or solution process.
7. **Review** with increasing intervals (1 day, 3 days, 1 week).
8. Final test: teach, explain, or solve from memory; refine **weak** **spots**.
