1. **Reciprocity** - make someone indebted
2. **Rejection Retreat** - start with a big request likely to be refused, followed by the desired smaller request, making it seem more reasonable
3. **Scarcity** - primal fear of someone else getting something you didn't, fear of missing out, when somethings hard to get makes it more desirable
4. **Banning** - forbidden things are more valuable
5. **Consistency** - people try to stay consistent with their previous behaviour, small concessions lead to further collaboration
6. **Hard Work** - the more you invest the more you convince yourself it was worth it
7. **Social Proof** - herd mentality, sitcom laugh tracks, the bystander effect, when you're unsure of what's happening, you freeze, waiting for someone to lead the way
8. **Similarity** - if someone acts looks like you, dresses like you, you're going to trust the person more than yourself, suicide news result in spikes in suicide rates, you trust their advice not because it's the best, but because it feels like an advice from a friend
9. **Likability** - the person selling you stuff isn't a stranger, he's your friend, someone you trust, **Halo Effect**, good cop, bad cop
10. **Authority** - humans have an ingrained respect for symbols of authority, blind obedience
