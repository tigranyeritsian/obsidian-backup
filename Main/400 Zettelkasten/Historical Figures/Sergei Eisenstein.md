## Eisenstein as a Propagandist

Eisenstein worked during a time when the Soviet regime, under Lenin and later Stalin, viewed cinema as the most powerful tool for **shaping public opinion** and **promoting socialist ideals**.

### How he served propaganda goals:

- **Promoted Marxist ideology**  
    Films like _Battleship Potemkin_ (1925) and _October_ (1928) glorified the collective struggle, revolution, and the working class, aligning with the Communist Party's message.
    
- **Depicted history through a Soviet lens**  
    He reinterpreted historical events to fit revolutionary ideals — for example, he emphasized the heroism of the masses and downplayed or villainized opponents of the revolution.
    
- **Avoided individual heroes**  
    In contrast to Western cinema, Eisenstein focused on the **collective hero** — the people — to reinforce the idea that historical change comes from class struggle, not individuals.
    
- **Was supported and censored by the state**  
    Although he received state funding, he also had to work within ideological constraints. Some of his projects, like _Bezhin Meadow_, were banned for not aligning with Stalinist orthodoxy.

## Eisenstein’s Inventions and Contributions

### 1. **Montage Theory**

Eisenstein’s most famous contribution — a theory of editing that emphasizes the **collision of shots** to produce meaning beyond the images themselves.

- **Types of montage** (he outlined several kinds):
    
    - **Metric:** based on the length of shots
        
    - **Rhythmic:** considers movement within the frame
        
    - **Tonal:** emphasizes emotional tone
        
    - **Overtonal:** combines metric, rhythmic, and tonal
        
    - **Intellectual:** uses editing to create abstract or ideological meanings (e.g. a lion montage in _October_ to symbolize political power)
        

> Famous example: _Odessa Steps_ scene in _Battleship Potemkin_ — fast, jarring cuts build emotional intensity and align the audience with the victims.

### 2. **Typage**

Instead of casting professional actors, Eisenstein used **non-professional actors** who “looked the part” to represent social types — peasants, soldiers, workers — reinforcing collective identity and class roles.

---

### 3. **Visual Metaphor and Symbolism**

He used strong imagery to evoke political ideas. For instance:

- A smashed plate = class breakdown
    
- A rising sun = revolution
    
- Religious icons being compared to political figures = ideological critique

### 4. **Theatrical Influence**

He incorporated methods from **Kabuki theatre** and **Constructivist art**, blending exaggerated gestures, symbolic space, and non-linear storytelling to heighten ideological impact.

## Legacy

- He laid the foundation for **modern film editing**, and his theories influenced directors from Hitchcock to Scorsese.
    
- He showed that **cinema could be more than entertainment** — it could manipulate, inspire, and revolutionize.
