**Niccolò Machiavelli** (1469–1527) was an Italian diplomat, writer, and political theorist. He is best known for his political treatise _The Prince_, which is considered a foundational work in modern political philosophy.

### Key Facts

- Born in Florence, Italy
    
- Worked as a diplomat for the Florentine Republic
    
- Imprisoned and exiled after the Medici family returned to power
    
- Wrote _The Prince_ in 1513 but published posthumously in 1532
    
### Core Ideas

**1. Politics is separate from morality**  
Machiavelli argued that rulers should not be bound by conventional morality. Instead, their actions should be guided by the need to maintain power and stability.

**2. The ends justify the means**  
A leader may use deceit, violence, or cruelty if it helps secure the state. Results matter more than ethical purity.

**3. Fortune vs. Virtù**  
Machiavelli believed that fortune (chance) controls half of human affairs, but the other half is determined by virtù—meaning skill, courage, and decisiveness.

**4. Appear virtuous, even if you are not**  
A ruler does not need to be morally good but should appear to be so. Reputation is essential for maintaining authority.

**5. Better to be feared than loved (but not hated)**  
Fear creates obedience and stability. While love is fragile, fear—if managed carefully—is a more reliable tool of rule.

**6. Realism over idealism**  
Unlike earlier thinkers who wrote about ideal republics, Machiavelli focused on how power actually works in the real world.

### Legacy
