**Trading Performance**
Fabio Valentini stands as one of the world's best day traders and scalpers, with remarkable returns in the Robins World Cup trading championships: 69%, 90%, 218%, and over 160% in consecutive competitions. With over 2,000 trades across 12 months, he has generated seven figures of wealth through trading alone.

**Dynamic Risk Management**
Fabio implements a dynamic risk management system classifying setups from A to C. C setups allow maximum €1,000-€1,500 risk, while A setups (with maximum statistical hedge) permit €2,500-€3,000 risk. This approach enables him to start conservatively and increase risk as the day progresses based on performance.

**Market Analysis and Order Flow**
Critical to Fabio's trading is analyzing order flow using volume and cumulative volume delta. He identifies market makers and institutional activity through price action and volume analysis, distinguishing between trapped buyers and momentum moves. This allows him to see who is winning the battle between buyers and sellers in real-time.

**Scalping Strategies**
Fabio focuses on high-probability setups with favorable risk-to-reward ratios (1:3 or better). Key strategies include identifying absorption areas, trapped buyers/sellers, and momentum moves. He emphasizes that even scalpers need patience to wait for ideal entry points rather than forcing trades at random levels.

**Position Building Techniques**
The trader employs position building to compound profits and reduce emotional pressure. By securing small profits early, he can take subsequent positions with reduced risk or no risk at all. This approach helps maintain psychological discipline during challenging market conditions.

**Trading Session Highlights**
During the documented session, Fabio demonstrated how he adapts to changing market conditions by switching biases when order flow data contradicts his initial narrative. He highlights the importance of flexibility in trading without ego, using volume analysis to confirm market strength or weakness before committing to positions.
