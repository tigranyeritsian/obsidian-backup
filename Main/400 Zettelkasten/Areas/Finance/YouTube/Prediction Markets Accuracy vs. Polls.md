**Historical Accuracy**  
Prediction markets often outperform polls and expert analysis, correctly forecasting events like the 2024 presidential outcome early and predicting Leicester City's 5000-to-1 Premier League upset. Historical election markets (1889–1940) predicted winners 100% accurately on Election Day, surpassing polls.  

**Mechanics of Prediction Markets**  
These markets function as probability trading platforms. Participants buy/sell tickets priced between $0 and $1, where the price reflects the event's perceived likelihood (e.g., $0.64 = 64% chance). Market prices adjust in real-time based on trading activity, incorporating all available information—including expert opinions, insider knowledge, and crowd sentiment.  

**Wisdom of Crowds**  
The accuracy stems from the "wisdom of crowds," where diverse, even uninformed, guesses collectively average near-perfect predictions (e.g., Galton's ox experiment, where 800 guesses averaged within 1 lb of the actual weight). Biases cancel out, creating a reliable aggregate belief.  

**Comparison to Traditional Methods**  
Unlike polls or expert analysis, prediction markets combine crowd wisdom with dynamic price discovery. They absorb real-time data shifts, as seen in Super Bowl III, where betting flows foreshadowed the Jets' victory. Bookmakers balance odds by adjusting prices based on money flow, ensuring markets reflect collective confidence.  

**Potential Limitations**  
While robust, prediction markets aren't infallible. They can't account for unknown unknowns and may incorporate manipulable information. Their probabilistic nature (bounded between 0 and 1) offers confidence levels rather than certainties, acting as a "weather service" for future events.
