Historical Context
Ancient Greek city-states were independent urban centers with surrounding territories. Athens emerged as the most documented during its political Golden Age (507-321 BCE), inventing democracy. The term derives from Greek "demos" (people) and "kratos" (power), meaning "rule by the people." After Athens fell, democracy wasn't practiced again until the founding of the United States 2,000 years later, though the American form differs significantly. This comparison explores their origins, democratic principles, and undemocratic aspects.

**Athenian Democracy**  
Athens evolved through three key reforms:  
1.  **Solon (c. 594 BCE):** Addressed class conflict by canceling debts, creating a new legal code applying equally to all free men, and politically organizing citizens by income, granting limited rights to the poor (thetes). Established the rule of law, with the Council of the Areopagus dominated by elites.  
2.  **Cleisthenes (508 BCE):** Reorganized Athens into ten tribes and local demes, enabling elections to a new Council of 500 (chosen by lot) and ten generals. Thetes gained assembly and court access but couldn't hold office.  
3.  **Pericles (mid-5th century BCE):** Broke the power of the Areopagus, leading to the Golden Age. Power resided with the citizen body.  

**Key Principles & Institutions**  
*   **Rule of Law:** All, including leaders, were subject to law, seen as civilizing and protecting against arbitrary power.  
*   **Isonomia (Equality Under Law):** Political equality emerged, partly driven by military culture linking service to power. Athens' navy, manned by thetes (poor citizens), secured victories (Marathon, Salamis), boosting their confidence and political influence.  
*   **Direct Democracy:** Citizens directly controlled major institutions:  
    *   **Ekklesia (Assembly):** Met monthly on the Pnyx; debated issues with equal speech rights (isegoria); voted on policy by show of hands. Held supreme sovereign power.  
    *   **Boule (Council of 500):** Prepared assembly agenda; members chosen by lot annually.  
    *   **Dikasteria (Courts):** Massive juries (avg. 500) chosen by lot decided cases; no lawyers or judges.  
*   **Officials:** Most chosen by lot (e.g., council members, jurors); few elected (generals, architects). Generals served one-year terms, subject to public review but could be re-elected.  

**Exclusions and Limitations**  
Democracy was exclusive: only free, native-born adult male citizens (~10-20% of the population) participated. Women, slaves (~80,000), metics (foreigners), and non-Athenians were excluded. Greeks viewed slaves and barbarians as psychologically incompatible with free politics. Slaves performed essential labor, enabling citizen participation; some had protections but were generally unfree. Women were confined to the domestic sphere, politically invisible. Ostracism allowed exiling unpopular citizens for 10 years, a peaceful but potentially manipulatable process. Democracy became expensive, leading to imperial expansion and resentment, culminating in Athens' subjugation by Macedon in 321 BCE.

**American Democracy**  
The US founders were largely unfamiliar with Athenian democracy, more influenced by Roman republicanism and the interchangeable terms "republic" and "democracy." Two conflicting narratives shaped its creation:  
1.  **Rejecting Authority & Embracing Equality (Jefferson/Paine):** Colonists rejected monarchical patronage and embraced equality of opportunity and spirit ("all men are created equal"). Property became linked to independence and freedom.  
2.  **Skepticism of Pure Democracy (Madison/Adams):** Founders feared pure democracies (like Athens) as turbulent and dangerous to property and rights. They believed unchecked power, especially majority rule, would oppress minorities or destroy itself.  

The Constitution addressed this by creating a **representative democracy** with complex checks and balances:  
*   **Separation of Powers:** Legislative (bicameral), Executive, Judicial branches with mutual oversight.  
*   **Federalism:** Divided power between national and state governments.  
*   **Limits on Majority Power:** Bill of Rights, independent judiciary, electoral college (indirectly).  
*   **Representative Selection:** Citizens elected officials (president, Congress), who would be held accountable through elections. This was seen as practical for a large nation and a check on "excesses" of popular opinion.  

Early American democracy was limited: only white male property holders could vote. Over time, the franchise expanded significantly (end of slavery, women's suffrage, civil rights), making "the people" broadly realized. However, public control remains indirect and constrained through elections, with significant power held by unelected institutions and processes, limiting overall control.

**Conclusion on Democracy**  
*   **Athens:** Highly democratic in citizen *control* (direct, thorough) but highly undemocratic in *scope* (only a minority of the population were citizens). Its exclusions were typical for its time.  
*   **America:** Broadly realized "the people" (nearly all adult citizens) but with significantly *limited control* (indirect, constrained by institutions). While a democracy, its institutions are "about as undemocratic as they can be while still deserving the name" (Dahl), balancing democratic principles with stability and minority protection. Democracy is not inherently maximized; its appropriate level depends on context.
