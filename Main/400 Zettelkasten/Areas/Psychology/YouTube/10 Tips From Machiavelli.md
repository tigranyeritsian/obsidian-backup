## 1. **Distrust Mercenaries and Auxiliaries**

Don't rely on hired or foreign troops — they’re disloyal and unreliable. Build your own military with shared interests.

## 2. **Imitate Great Leaders, but Be Flexible**

Study successful historical figures and learn from their habits, but be ready to adapt and act independently when needed.

## 3. **Do Not Empower Rivals**

Avoid alliances that strengthen others more than yourself. Empowering a rival can backfire and cost you control.

## 4. **Respect Local Customs When Conquering**

To win over newly conquered people, keep their laws and taxes mostly intact. Let them govern locally as long as they stay loyal.

## 5. **Power and Opportunity Must Align**

Neither power nor opportunity alone guarantees success. A smart leader creates both and doesn't rely on luck (fortune).

## 6. **Work Within the System to Succeed**

Idealism can be dangerous. It’s better to master the system and use it effectively than try to reform it and fail.

## 7. **Balance Support Between Nobles and People**

Nobles seek power; people seek protection. It's safer to have public support — if the people back you, the nobles struggle to dethrone you.

## 8. **Appear Virtuous, Even If You’re Not**

A ruler should seem moral — generous, religious, and fair — but act ruthlessly when necessary. Politics is about outcomes, not appearances.

## 9. **It’s Better to Be Feared Than Loved**

Fear ensures control more than love. If you must choose, fear is more reliable — but avoid being hated.

## 10. **Commit Cruelty Quickly, Not Gradually**

If harsh actions are needed, do them all at once. Prolonged cruelty builds resentment; swift action builds fear and stability.
