Standard Oil's Move to New Jersey**  
Standard Oil faced legal challenges in Ohio, prompting a reorganization to New Jersey in 1892. This exploited a loophole allowing New Jersey corporations to hold out-of-state stock. The "trust" was dissolved nominally, but control remained centralized in New York, with Rockefeller's inner circle directing operations remotely.  

**Rockefeller's Retirement and Philanthropy**  
Rockefeller retired from day-to-day operations in 1891, though he retained the titular presidency. Stressed by public hatred and the burden of wealth, he focused on philanthropy, hiring Frederick Gates to systematize giving. Key initiatives included funding Spelman College, the University of Chicago, and establishing the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now Rockefeller University), which produced 38 Nobel laureates. They modernized medical education by funding schools like Johns Hopkins' model across the U.S.  

**Antitrust Pressures and Tarbell's Exposé**  
Theodore Roosevelt, as New York governor and later president, aggressively pursued antitrust actions. Ida Tarbell's 1901–1903 McClure's series exposed Standard Oil's predatory practices, including secret subsidiaries and railroads sharing competitor data. This public outcry, combined with Roosevelt's unwavering stance ("bought the son of a b****, but he wouldn't stay bought"), fueled federal scrutiny.  

**The 1911 Breakup**  
After a landmark Supreme Court ruling, Standard Oil was ordered to break into 34 independent companies by December 1911. Rockefeller, though "bankrupted" on paper, profited immensely as the spun-off entities (Exxon, Mobil, Chevron, Amoco, etc.) surged in value. His wealth grew from $300M in 1911 to $900M by 1913, cementing his status as history's first billionaire.  

**Rockefeller Family Legacy**  
The family's wealth endures through ventures like Venrock (early Apple investor) and philanthropic institutions. Notable contributions include Acadia National Park, Colonial Williamsburg, MoMA, and the UN land donation. Standard Oil's descendants now divest from fossil fuels.
