# Executive Summary

**Business name (placeholder):** **FixerHub Armenia** (changeable)

**Business concept:** a marketplace app + website that connects vetted local tradespeople (plumbers, electricians, carpenters, welders, mechanics, shoemakers, masons, and device technicians) with customers in Yerevan and major marzes. Revenue from a percentage take-rate per job, optional subscription plans for professionals, priority listing / advertising, and value-added services (warranty, parts procurement). Focus: fast bookings, vetted ratings, in-app payments, and guaranteed service quality.

**Stage & ask:** early stage / MVP → seeking startup funding **(example ask: 34–40 million AMD / ≈ $85–105k)** to build MVP app, initial marketing in Yerevan, hire core staff, and run first 12 months. (I give a conservative funding estimate in Funding Requirements below.)

**Quick financial snapshot (conservative projections):**

- Year 1 revenue (platform fees): **27,000,000 AMD** (≈ $70.6k).
    
- Year 1 net operating result (after operating expenses, before startup spend): **-8,000,000 AMD**.
    
- Year 1 cash flow including startup spend: **-24,800,000 AMD** (≈ −$64.8k).
    
- Year 2 net operating result: **+16,640,000 AMD** (≈ $43.5k).
    
- Year 3 net operating result: **+86,800,000 AMD** (≈ $226.9k).

# Market Analysis (with real competitors & trends)

## Market context & demand (high level)

- Armenia’s urban population (Yerevan) and diaspora ties create a steady demand for home repair & maintenance. Consumers increasingly expect convenience and online booking (global on-demand trend). On-demand home-services apps and marketplaces are a global trend post-COVID. ([Developer Bazaar Technologies](https://developerbazaar.com/top-20-on-demand-home-services-app-ideas/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Top 20 On-Demand Home Services App Ideas in 2025 -"))
    

## Competitor landscape (local — representative)

I researched active platforms and providers in Armenia you must benchmark and differentiate from:

- **Turn.am** — a broad “find a service” listings/marketplace covering plumbers, electricians, auto repair and more (large directory-style platform). ([Turn.am](https://turn.am/en?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Find a Service in Armenia — Fast, Easy & Free"))
    
- **Varpet** — app/website focusing on household and construction services (plumbing, carpentry, renovation) and a recognized local brand. ([varpet.com](https://varpet.com/en?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Varpet - When everything is ok"))
    
- **Tun Service (Տուն Սերվիս)** — home emergency & maintenance service with an online presence and 24/7 positioning. ([tunservice.com](https://www.tunservice.com/Eng/Tun-Service.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Home Maintenance Services - Yerevan"))
    
- **Yerashkhiq / Yeservice** — local service companies offering plumbing/electric work with booking information online. ([yeservice.am](https://yeservice.am/en/services/plumbing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Plumbing - Yerashkhiq Service"))
    
- **Niche repair shops** (computer/phone repair centers like i-service.am) and many single-shop providers listed on directories and pages.am. ([I Service](https://i-service.am/en/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Repair, maintenance, and rental of digital equipment in Yerevan"))
    

**Takeaway:** multiple local players but mostly directory/listing or single-service companies. The **opportunity** is a unified, reliable, app-first marketplace with vetted technicians, standardized service packs, and in-app payments/guarantees.

## Current trends to leverage

- Growth in mobile usage and e-commerce in Armenia → mobile-first approach recommended. ([Developer Bazaar Technologies](https://developerbazaar.com/top-20-on-demand-home-services-app-ideas/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Top 20 On-Demand Home Services App Ideas in 2025 -"))
    
- Platform models (commission + subscription) are accepted globally; local players are fragmented — opportunity to centralize. (Existence of platform players like Varpet and Turn.am confirms market interest but also that the space is not monopolized.) ([varpet.com](https://varpet.com/en?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Varpet - When everything is ok"))
    
- Business software interest in Armenia (global players opening offices in Armenia — e.g., ServiceTitan presence shows talent pool for service techs / SaaS familiarity). ([ServiceTitan](https://www.servicetitan.com/press/servicetitan-opens-office-in-armenia?utm_source=chatgpt.com "ServiceTitan Opens Office in Armenia"))

# Target Customer Persona

I recommend starting with two primary personas:

1. **Urban Busy Professional — “Anahit”**
    
    - Age 28–45, lives in Yerevan apartment, works full-time, values convenience and time savings.
        
    - Needs: quick, reliable fixes (plumbing, electrician, device repair). Will pay for speed & guarantee.
        
    - Channels: Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, Google search.
        
2. **Small Landlord / Property Manager — “Vahan”**
    
    - Age 35–55, owns rental apartments/guest rooms. Needs regular maintenance and trusted contractors for recurring jobs.
        
    - Needs: streamlined recurring access, monthly billing, fast dispatch, reliable workmanship.
        
    - Channels: Facebook groups, local classifieds, direct outreach.
        

(You should add more personas later: rural homeowners, small SMB owners, diaspora ordering repairs for relatives, etc. — use actual customer interviews to refine.)

---

# Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

**“Trusted, guaranteed local masters — book vetted repair pros in minutes with transparent pricing and secure in-app payments.”**

Key differentiators:

- **Vetting + Warranty**: background/ID verification, minimum review score to join, 7–30 day workmanship warranty for platform-booked jobs.
    
- **Transparent pricing**: standardized service packs (e.g., “Sink unclog + inspection” price band) to reduce price shock.
    
- **Fast dispatch & real photos**: ETA tracking, photos of technician and tools.
    
- **Single platform for many trades** (one booking for multi-trade small projects).
    

---

# Marketing & Go-to-Market Strategy

## Phase 1 — MVP launch (Month 0–6) — Yerevan focus

- **Channels:** Facebook & Instagram ads (target neighborhoods), Telegram community outreach, Google Local search SEO, partnerships with apartment management companies, and targeted flyers in neighborhoods.
    
- **Offer:** Launch promotion — discounted first job (e.g., 20% off) + “first-time user guarantee.” Referral program (customer and provider referral bonuses).
    
- **PR & PR influencer:** Local tech blogs, neighborhood Facebook groups, and diaspora channels to spread word. Leverage Varpet/Turn.am existence as validation when pitching press. ([varpet.com](https://varpet.com/en?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Varpet - When everything is ok"))
    

## Phase 2 — Scale (Month 6–24)

- Expand service area beyond Yerevan to 2–4 other marzes; focus on higher frequency categories (plumbing, electrical, mechanics).
    
- Onboard providers via incentives: low initial platform fees for first 3 months, free training webinars, onboarding support.
    
- B2B sales to property managers and construction firms for recurring contracts.
    

## CAC & Retention

- Start with measured CAC via digital ads. Expect initially higher CAC (promos + onboarding). Prioritize retention: subscription/warranty + easy rebooking reduces CAC over time.
    

**Marketing budget (example):** Year1 marketing: 8,000,000 AMD (digital ads, local outreach). Adjust after validating CAC/LTV.

---

# Operational Plan

## Daily operational activities

- **Customer intake & dispatch:** Customer places booking → customer success confirms details → dispatch to available provider within X minutes.
    
- **Provider verification & scheduling:** Verify provider documents, complete KYC, run initial trial jobs.
    
- **Payments processing & disbursement:** Capture payment in app; release provider payout after job completion and holding period for disputes.
    
- **Quality control & follow-ups:** Post-job feedback, warranty claims processing, occasional spot checks.
    

## Suppliers / Partners

- **Parts suppliers & spare parts wholesalers**: local electro, plumbing parts suppliers (negotiate preferred rates).
    
- **Payment gateway**: integrate a local payment gateway supporting cards and local methods (check bank fees).
    
- **Logistics**: For items (e.g., parts) coordinate same-day procurement with local stores or use provider to procure via platform purchase.
    
- **Insurance partner**: liability insurance for providers or platform-offered job insurance.
    

## Staffing (initial core team — Year 1)

- **Founder / CEO** (often co-founder who owns product + biz dev) — part-time salary initially.
    
- **Operations Manager** (1 FTE) — provider onboarding, dispatch oversight.
    
- **Customer Support / Dispatcher** (1–2 FTE) — handle bookings, complaints, scheduling.
    
- **Tech / Product contractor or 1 in-house dev** — build and maintain app/website. (Initial dev is likely contracted to an agency.)
    
- **Sales / B2B rep** (0.5–1 FTE part time) — onboard property managers & service partners.
    
- **Finance/Accountant (outsourced)** during Year 1.
    

(Adjust headcount as volumes grow. See Financials for assumed salaries used in projections — these are placeholders; research market wages in Armenia for exact payroll planning.)

## Location & equipment

- Home / small office initially (lower rent). Equip core staff with laptops, phones, headsets. Providers use their own tools; platform supplies optional starter kits for selected partners.

# Financial Projections — 3-Year (realistic & conservative)

### Summary of main assumptions

- **Currency:** AMD. (USD approximations shown; 1 USD ≈ 382.6 AMD). ([Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/armenia/currency?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Armenian Dram - Quote - Chart - Historical Data - News"))
    
- **Revenue model:** platform _take rate_ on GMV (15% Year1, 17% Year2, 18% Year3). Additional revenue streams (subscriptions, advertising, parts markup) are assumed small in Year1.
    
- **Average ticket:** 25,000 AMD Year1, 27,000 AMD Year2, 30,000 AMD Year3 (you must validate with local pricing). **[PLACEHOLDER — replace with your market research]**
    
- **Jobs booked (annual):** Year1 = 7,200 (≈600/month), Year2 = 18,000, Year3 = 36,000. Conservative ramp from early traction to scale. **[ADJUST with real traction targets]**
    
- **Payment processing fees:** 3% of GMV (platform bears this).
    
- **Operational staff costs, marketing and other opex** are conservative estimates; see line items below — **you must validate** local salary benchmarks and dev costs.

### Income statement (condensed, AMD)

|Year|GMV (AMD)|Platform Revenue (Take-rate)|Payment fees (3% GMV)|Gross profit (Revenue − payment fees)|Opex (salaries+marketing+office+other+tech)|Net operating result|
|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
|**Year 1**|180,000,000|27,000,000|5,400,000|21,600,000|29,600,000|**−8,000,000**|
|**Year 2**|486,000,000|82,620,000|14,580,000|68,040,000|51,400,000|**+16,640,000**|
|**Year 3**|1,080,000,000|194,400,000|32,400,000|162,000,000|75,200,000|**+86,800,000**|

(See detailed line items / assumptions below.)

**USD approximations (for context):**

- Year1 revenue ≈ **$70.6k**; Year1 cashflow including startup ≈ **−$64.8k**. (1 USD ≈ 382.6 AMD). ([Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/armenia/currency?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Armenian Dram - Quote - Chart - Historical Data - News"))
    

---

### Breakout of key line items & assumptions (placeholders you must confirm)

**Revenue drivers**

- Jobs × average ticket × take rate.
    

**Opex breakdown (example assumptions per year):**

- Salaries (Year1): 18,000,000 AMD — (Operations manager + 2 support/dispatch staff; replace with local salary data). **[RESEARCH: current local wages for these roles]**
    
- Marketing (Year1): 8,000,000 AMD — initial digital and offline acquisitions, PR. **[ADJUST after you calculate CAC target]**
    
- Office & utilities (Year1): 2,400,000 AMD.
    
- Other (legal/accounting/insurance) (Year1): 1,200,000 AMD.
    
- Dev & initial app cost (one-time): 6,000,000 AMD (agency build). **[GET 3 dev quotes — placeholder!]**
    
- Startup other costs (branding, initial equipment, contingency): 10,800,000 AMD (one-time).
    
- Ongoing dev/maintenance: 3,000,000 AMD Year2; 4,000,000 AMD Year3.
    

**Cash flow (simple):**

- Year1 net cash flow after startup and dev: **−24,800,000 AMD** (startup + dev + operating loss).
    
- Year2 cash flow: **+16,640,000 AMD**.
    
- Year3 cash flow: **+86,800,000 AMD**.
    

(Full monthly cashflow and income statement templates should be built in a spreadsheet — I can prepare an XLSX if you want.)

# Funding Requirements (example ask & uses)

**Suggested initial raise:** **~28–36 million AMD (≈ $73k–94k)** as seed/MVP funding. Use breakdown:

- **App + web MVP (agency)**: 6,000,000 AMD (placeholder — get quotes).
    
- **Initial marketing & launch**: 8,000,000 AMD.
    
- **Staffing (6–9 months runway)**: 9,000,000–12,000,000 AMD.
    
- **Legal, accounting, licences & insurance**: 1,500,000 AMD.
    
- **Working capital / contingency**: 3,000,000 AMD.
    

**Total example:** ~28,500,000 AMD. If you want 12–18 months runway and room for stronger growth / expansion, target **~40 million AMD**. Final ask depends on owner contribution and anticipated burn.

_Note:_ I used conservative startup caps. Get actual quotes for dev, local payroll, and marketing CPMs.

# SWOT Analysis

**Strengths**

- One-stop marketplace across many trades (convenience).
    
- Early mover advantage if you focus on reliability / warranty.
    
- Low inventory risk (platform model).
    

**Weaknesses**

- Trust & quality control challenges (must vet providers).
    
- Customer acquisition cost initially may be high.
    
- Reliant on provider network quality.
    

**Opportunities**

- B2B contracts with landlords / property managers for recurring revenue.
    
- Value-added services (parts procurement, insurance, subscriptions).
    
- Expand to diaspora ordering for family repairs in Armenia.
    

**Threats**

- Local incumbents (Turn.am, Varpet, service companies) can compete or copy features. ([Turn.am](https://turn.am/en?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Find a Service in Armenia — Fast, Easy & Free"))
    
- Logistics/regulatory constraints (permits, VAT, insurance).
    
- Economic fluctuations affecting discretionary spending.
    

---

# Operational Risks & Mitigations (practical)

- **Risk: Low quality providers → bad ratings**. Mitigation: strict onboarding, trial jobs, guarantee fund, probation periods.
    
- **Risk: Cashflow stress in first 12 months.** Mitigation: staggered provider payouts, require small deposit on booking, lean hires, focus marketing to low CAC channels (referrals).
    
- **Risk: Payment fraud / disputes.** Mitigation: capture photos, time-stamped job completion, holdbacks until feedback window.
    

---

# Appendix — Practical next steps & required research (clear placeholders)

To turn this plan into an executable one you must research and decide on the following items (placeholders to fill):

1. **Provider pricing & average ticket per trade** — Run a quick survey or mystery shop 20 providers in Yerevan for real prices (fill _avg_ticket_). **[ACTION]** Gather 20 sample job estimates in plumbing, electrical, carpentry, auto repair, electronics, masonry, shoe repair.
    
2. **Local salary benchmarks & benefits** — Confirm local monthly wages for Ops Manager, Support, Sales, Dev. Replace my salary placeholders. **[ACTION]** Ask 3 local recruiters or check staff.am listings.
    
3. **App development quotes** — Get at least 3 quotes from Armenian dev agencies or freelancers for a 2-platform MVP + admin panel. Replace my 6,000,000 AMD placeholder. **[ACTION]** RFP to 3 vendors.
    
4. **Payment gateway fees & banking** — Select a gateway and confirm per-transaction fees and settlement times in AMD. These fees materially affect margins.
    
5. **Regulatory & tax treatment** — Get local accountant guidance on VAT, withholding, and provider classification (contractor vs employee).
    
6. **Provider legal coverage & insurance** — quote liability insurance options and cost per year.
    
7. **Customer acquisition data** — run small pilot ads to estimate CAC and conversion to booking. Use this to refine Year1 marketing spend.
