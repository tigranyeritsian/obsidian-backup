**Current State of American Trucks**
American trucks are large in cabs but have maintained freight dimensions from the last century. While other freight systems like trains and ships have grown larger, US trucks remain legally limited to 80,000 lb.

**Historical Development**
Trucking grew with the automotive industry, facing early weight regulations. The 1956 interstate highway system adoption led to standardized federal weight limits and the popularity of large-nosed trucks for American drivers who prefer comfort on long hauls.

**Regulatory Stagnation**
The 1982 federal regulations fixed trailer lengths and weight limits at 80,000 lb partly due to bridge structural concerns. This created a 40-year period with minimal truck size innovation while trailer capacities remained static despite technological advances.

**International Comparisons**
While American trucks remain unchanged, other countries have progressed:
- Nordic countries permit 120-ton trucks with 113-foot trailers
- Australia allows road trains up to 175 feet and 300,000 lb
- These larger trucks feature better safety features and more efficient engines

**Economic Implications**
Bigger trucks offer greater efficiency with lower cost per ton-mile and reduced environmental impact (33% lower emissions). Trucking productivity has increased only one-fifth as much as rail productivity since 1990, despite transporting 65% of American goods.

**Safety and Technology**
International trucks include multiple airbags, advanced camera systems, emergency braking, and lane departure warnings missing in American models. Safety studies show truck length doesn't necessarily increase danger when proper technology is implemented.

**Path Forward**
The author suggests studying the Finnish model to responsibly increase truck sizes, potentially boosting economic efficiency and reducing environmental impact while maintaining safety standards.
