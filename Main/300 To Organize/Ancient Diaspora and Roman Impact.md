Ancient Diaspora and Roman Impact**  
Peoples like Greeks, Phoenicians, and Hebrews established vast diasporas through trade. By the 1st century BCE, the global Jewish population was 4-6 million, with significant communities in Palestine (2 million) and the diaspora (3 million). The Roman Jewish wars devastated Jewish communities, annihilating diaspora centers in Cyprus, Alexandria, and Libya. Jerusalem's temple was destroyed, Judea depopulated, and Jewish life shifted to Galilee and Babylon, outside Roman control. Roman persecution initiated a millennium of European anti-Semitism.

**Zionist Ideology's Colonial Roots**  
Zionism emerged in 19th-century Europe as a response to violent anti-Semitism, particularly Tsarist pogroms. It reimagined Judaism through the lens of European ethnonationalism and colonial settlement, framing colonization as a civilizing duty. Zionists recast Jewish history: the ancient diaspora became a victim narrative of powerlessness after Rome, replacing theological explanations of exile with political solutions â€“ building a nation-state through human effort. This simplified narrative ("kicked out by Romans, returning home") and the "land without people" myth facilitated colonization.

**Balfour's Role and Racist Foundations**  
Zionism found key support from British Lord Balfour. His Aliens Act (1905) cited real harms from Jewish immigration. Weizmann, leveraging scientific contributions to Britain, secured Balford's backing for a Jewish state via the Balfour Declaration. For Balfour, this solved Jewish immigration into Britain and created a strategic European outpost against "barbarism," safeguarding the Suez Canal. Balfour openly dismissed the rights of non-European peoples ("subject races"), declaring inherent racial inequality and explicitly stating the wishes of Palestine's Arab inhabitants would not be consulted, as treaties didn't apply to "brown people."

**Persistence as Unique Colonial Legacy**  
Zionism's distinction lies not in its racist colonial origins or religious justifications (common for its era), but in its unique persistence. While numerous apartheid settler colonies existed a century ago, today only one remains.
