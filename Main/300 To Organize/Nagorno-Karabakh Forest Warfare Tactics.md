Terrain Advantages**  
Mountain-forest terrain favors offensive maneuvers, enabling infiltration despite limited visibility and dense cover. Azerbaijan successfully used this for initial advances, capturing key heights like Malikjan.  

**Azerbaijan Tactics**  
Azerbaijan employs diversionary-reconnaissance groups (DRG) to sow panic, disrupt supply lines, and fix Armenian forces. Supported by artillery and drones, DRG transitions into larger infantry operations using roads for logistics and armored thrusts.  

**Armenian Weaknesses**  
Armenia lacks the manpower for systematic forest clearance ("prochessivanie"). Limited resources prevent effective counter-infiltration, relying on local militias vulnerable to ambushes on main roads.  

**Shusha Strategic Value**  
Shusha's dominance doesn't guarantee safety; forested approaches north-northeast enable flanking threats. Azerbaijanean pressure forces Armenian redeployment, potentially isolating Shusha/Stepanakert.  

**Battle Dynamics**  
Urban combat near Shusha appears inevitable. Azerbaijan may attempt rapid encirclement or direct assault, exploiting momentum and external pressure, potentially collapsing Armenian defenses before a full siege.
