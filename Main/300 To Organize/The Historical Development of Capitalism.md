**Origins and Context**  
Capitalism emerged from feudalism, a rigid system where 80-94% of the population were peasants bound to the land. Feudalism was static, with famines and short lifespans. The transition began with broad societal shifts: the Age of Discovery expanded horizons, the Renaissance fostered new ideas, the printing press spread knowledge, the Reformation encouraged tolerance, and the Scientific Revolution emphasized experimentation. These factors "fertilized the soil" for capitalism, though capitalism itself was unplanned and emerged from multiple, overlapping causes.

**England's Unique Path**  
England's cohesive institutions, stable property rights, and agricultural revolution—featuring innovations like crop rotation and enclosure movements—freed up labor and capital. The patent system incentivized invention, while a demilitarized nobility turned to commerce. By 1800, only 36% of England's population farmed, compared to 80% globally, freeing resources for industry.

**The Industrial Revolution**  
Key inventions, starting with Thomas Savery's and Thomas Newcomen's steam engines, drove productivity. James Watt's improvements made steam power efficient, revolutionizing mining, manufacturing, and transportation. Innovations like Richard Arkwright's water frame and subsequent mechanization of textiles led to exponential growth. Britain became the "workshop of the world," with cotton processing exploding from 2.5 million pounds in 1760 to 366 million by 1840.

**Global Spread and Consequences**  
Capitalism's "Promethean" growth reshaped the world. Railways, telegraphs, and steamships connected economies, enabling globalization. However, this expansion was violent and exploitative, tied to colonialism, slavery, and resource extraction. Empires like Britain's grew as capitalism sought markets and raw materials, leading to famines in India and Ireland. The system also generated inequality, slums, and labor strife, sparking protests and early unionization.

**Corporate Consolidation and the Gilded Age**  
By the late 19th century, capitalism evolved from individual entrepreneurs to massive corporations. Figures like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller built monopolies, economies of scale, and managerial bureaucracies. In America, the Ford assembly line epitomized mass production, but corporate power led to antitrust laws and violent labor conflicts.

**Crises and Conflicts**  
Capitalism's inherent instability caused panics and depressions, notably the 1873 crash and the 1929 Great Depression. Financial speculation and overinvestment led to global economic collapse. World War I is seen by historians like Eric Hobsbawm as a product of capitalist competition for markets and resources, fueled by nationalism and social Darwinism. The war devastated economies and lives, testing capitalism's resilience.

**Legacy and Ongoing Debate**  
Capitalism transformed societies, increasing material wealth but also inequality and alienation. It offered freedoms—economic and social—while constraining individuals through competition and systemic pressures. Its malleability allowed adaptation, but its future remains contested, shaped by cultural, political, and technological shifts.
