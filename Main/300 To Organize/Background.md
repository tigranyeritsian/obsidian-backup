Background**
Alex Karp was born in 1967 in NYC to a Jewish pediatrician father and an African-American artist mother who were civil rights activists. Despite this progressive upbringing, Karp pursued a different path. He graduated from Haverford College in 1983 and studied law at Stanford, where he met Peter Thiel. He later transferred to Goethe University in Germany, earning a PhD in neoclassical social theory. He founded the Cadman Group investment firm in 2005, funded by a family inheritance.

**Palantir's Formation**
In 2003, Peter Thiel, having sold PayPal for over $1 billion, called Karp to co-found Palantir. Thiel envisioned using PayPal's fraud detection technology on a massive scale for governments. Palantir became a software company integrating and analyzing vast datasets. Named after "seeing stones" from *Lord of the Rings*, the technology is described as powerful and potentially dangerous. Early investors included In-Q-Tel, the CIA/NSA/FBI venture fund, which provided crucial access to the CIA's largest database.

**Government Contracts**
Palantir's initial work (2003-2009) focused solely on US government contracts, particularly with intelligence agencies. Karp's perceived "differentness," paranoia, and refusal to conform were cited as assets in securing these deals. Palantir expanded to work with 13 agencies, including the military, by 2013. The company claimed its software aided in finding IEDs and tracking individuals, even suggesting involvement in locating Osama bin Laden. Joe Biden publicly thanked Palantir during this period.

**Controversial Projects**
Palantir faced controversy early on when its technology was used by HBGary to target journalists and critics of Bank of America (exposed by Anonymous). Karp distanced Palantir but the incident highlighted potential misuse. The company faced significant scrutiny over its involvement with Cambridge Analytica, helping harvest data to influence voters in the 2016 US election and Brexit. Palantir initially denied involvement, later blaming a single employee. Palantir's AI technology, Project Maven, was used by the IDF in Gaza, enabling rapid target identification (criticized as dehumanizing). The software is also used for predictive policing in the US, raising concerns about racial bias and privacy violations, with documented cases like Pasco County, Florida, leading to constitutional rights violations.

**Conclusion**
Karp's paranoia and fear of being targeted drive Palantir's actions. Despite claims of protecting civil liberties, Palantir's work with governments, military, and police directly undermines them. The company embodies a new form of fascism, controlling lives through algorithmic processing of data, intertwined with government power. Karp, once exposed to injustice, now operates a system facilitating surveillance and harm.
