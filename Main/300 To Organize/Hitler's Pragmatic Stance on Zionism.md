**Hitler's Antisemitic View of Zionism**
Hitler dismissed Zionism in *Mein Kampf* as a deceptive Jewish plot, claiming it sought a base for international swindling rather than a genuine homeland. He viewed it as part of a unified Jewish conspiracy, though he expressed disgust at the perceived division between Zionist and liberal Jews.

**Nazi-Zionist Collaboration: The Haavara Agreement**
In 1933, Nazi Germany and Zionists signed the Haavara Agreement to facilitate Jewish emigration to Palestine. The deal allowed German Jews to transfer assets, which funded German exports to Palestine. This served Nazi goals of segregating Jews and Zionist aims of building a Jewish state outside Europe, aiding ~20,000 Jews.

**Shifting Nazi Policy and Arab Alliances**
By 1937, Nazi concerns grew over Arab-Palestinian revolt and the potential strengthening of "international Jewry." Germany sought closer ties with Arab nationalists to counter Zionist influence, though Hitler temporarily allowed emigration for tactical reasons. Diplomats warned that supporting Zionism risked alienating Arab allies.

**Hitler's Ultimate Rejection**
As Nazi policy radicalized toward mass murder, Hitler's tactical use of Zionism faded. He increasingly conflated Zionism with broader Jewish threats like communism and finance, aiming for the eradication of European Jews rather than a Jewish homeland. Collaboration ended by the late 1930s.
