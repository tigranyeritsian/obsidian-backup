Essential Life Skills Assessment**

**Crafting**  
Once foundational to civilization, crafting involved guilds, apprenticeships, and mastery. Post-industrial revolution, it became niche. Despite being undervalued in a disposable culture, it teaches quality appreciation, problem-solving, spatial thinking, patience, and self-reliance. Tier: B (niche but valuable, especially for survival if supply chains collapse).

**Financial Literacy**  
A critical skill for resource control, yet 34% failed a basic profit test ($400 from cow transactions). Low literacy risks scams, bad loans, and misjudged risks. While not equivalent to wealth, it prevents loss. Chasing money beyond basic needs yields diminishing happiness returns. Tier: Highly important (S equivalent), but money isn't the sole focus.

**Cooking**  
Enabled human evolution by unlocking nutrients and freeing cognitive energy. Outsourcing is possible today, but cooking saves money, offers enjoyment, dietary control, cultural connection, and boosts attractiveness. It becomes vital for survival in societal breakdowns. Tier: C (overpowered due to easy outsourcing).

**Fitness**  
An S-tier skill essential for health, longevity, energy, disease prevention, and stress management. A hybrid build (aerobic + resistance) is recommended. While profession metas favor sedentary "desk builds," fitness remains meta-proof and crucial for survival (e.g., crises). Maximize early for future well-being.

**First Aid**  
A low-frequency, high-impact skill requiring calm action in emergencies (choking, bleeding, CPR). Basic training can save lives. Tier: B today (near hospitals/help), A for off-grid, S during societal collapse with no emergency services.

**Emotional Intelligence**  
An S+ tier skill encompassing self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. It enhances leadership, communication, conflict resolution, and resilience. Despite most overestimating self-awareness, it's trainable through journaling and active listening, making life smoother and more connected.
