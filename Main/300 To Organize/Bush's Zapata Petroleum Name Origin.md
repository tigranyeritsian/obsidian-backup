Bush's Zapata Petroleum Name Origin**  
George H.W. Bush named his oil company Zapata Petroleum after the 1952 film "Viva Zapata," starring Marlon Brando as Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. This naming is ironic given Bush's support for reactionary forces in Latin America, contrasting with Zapata's revolutionary legacy. The claim that this was Bush's favorite film is questioned, as the film had just been released before the company's formation.

**Financing and Early Partners**  
Initial funding for Zapata Petroleum came from silent partners, notably Bush's maternal uncle Herbert Walker Jr. and Washington Post owner Eugene Meyer. Wealthy oilmen Hugh and Bill Littkey, whom Bush met in Midland, Texas, provided expertise. The Littkeys guided drilling operations but led to 127 consecutive "wet holes," paradoxically boosting Zapata's stock value due to their industry reputation.

**Thomas Devine's CIA Role**  
Thomas Devine (also spelled Deine), an MIT graduate and CIA staff officer since 1949, was a key associate. His obituary confirms his CIA ties. Devine, from Northeastern "Yankee" circles like Bush, was an emissary to Texas. A 1975 CIA memo identifies Devine as a former CIA employee and "oil wild catting associate" who co-founded Zapata with Bush under the terminated project "W Bry" (LP Dictum). A 1968 memo describes Devine as Bush's "personal friend and unofficial Foreign Affairs advisor" and a "witting contact" in a firm managing a CIA proprietary corporation, "W Saline," linked to salt-related cryptonyms.

**Zapata as a CIA Front**  
Evidence suggests Zapata Petroleum and its offshoot, Zapata Offshore (founded in 1954), were CIA fronts. Devine likely coordinated CIA corporate operations in the Caribbean, using Bush as a "cutout." This model resembles the CIA's later venture capital firm In-Q-Tel. Devine collaborated with CIA asset George de Mohrenschildt on Caribbean operations, including Haiti. Bush and Devine remained close, traveling to Vietnam in 1967–68 amid CIA activities like the Phoenix Program.

**Zapata Offshore's Expansion and Losses**  
Despite Zapata Petroleum's profitability in West Texas, Bush shifted focus to high-risk offshore drilling via Zapata Offshore. Partnering with oilman Bill Clements Jr. (later a Texas governor and defense secretary), Zapata Offshore operated at a loss from 1957–58. The Littkey brothers sold their stake to Bush in 1959 and later founded Pennzoil. Bush's move away from profits is attributed to CIA priorities for Zapata Offshore.

**Caribbean Operations and Bay of Pigs**  
Zapata Offshore expanded internationally, with rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, Persian Gulf, and Borneo. Activities coincided with CIA operations, such as the 1957–58 Indonesian coup attempt. The company leased a plot near Cay Sal Island (Bahamas) from Howard Hughes in 1958, using it as a potential staging ground for the Bay of Pigs invasion (Operation Zapata). The "Scorpion" rig off Cay Sal may have trained Cuban exiles for Operation 40, an elite CIA unit. Bush and Jack Crichton allegedly fundraised for Operation 40 among Texas oilmen.

**Bush-CIA Relationship and Legacy**  
Bush was described as "perfect at talent spotting" for the CIA. Former agents note he provided discreet operational support, not spycraft. He exemplified a privatized intelligence model using corporate cover, later refined in Iran-Contra. Bush maintained ties to figures like Felix Rodriguez (Operation 40 leader), evidenced by a purported 1988 letter. Connections to de Mohrenschildt (linked to Lee Harvey Oswald) and the House Select Committee on Assassinations further tie Bush to intelligence circles.

**Bay of Pigs Aftermath**  
The Bay of Pigs failure (1961) strained relations between the CIA and the Kennedy administration. Director Allen Dulles resigned, while JFK increased oversight through brother Bobby's anti-Castro task force. Despite setbacks, anti-Castro operations grew, involving private backers and escalating tensions that contributed to JFK's assassination. The text concludes by linking Bush's early CIA ties to his later political and intelligence activities.
