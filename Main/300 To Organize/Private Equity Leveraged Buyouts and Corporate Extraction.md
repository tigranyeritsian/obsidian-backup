Private Equity Defined**  
Private equity (PE) firms purchase entire companies, taking them private or acquiring existing private businesses, using funds raised from wealthy investors, pension funds, and institutions. They target underperforming companies with the stated goal of improving and reselling them for profit, analogous to house flipping.

**Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs)**  
PE firms employ LBOs, financing acquisitions primarily with debt (80% or more). They use the target company's assets and cash flows as collateral for loans, placing the debt burden onto the acquired company rather than the PE firm itself. This minimizes the PE firm's initial equity investment.

**Profit Mechanisms**  
PE firms profit through three main methods:  
1.  **Management Fees:** A flat 2% fee annually on assets under management, paid regardless of performance.  
2.  **Performance Fees (Carried Interest):** 20% of profits generated when a company is successfully sold.  
3.  **Dividend Recaps:** Borrowing additional debt against the acquired company and paying themselves large "special dividends," extracting cash upfront while increasing the company's debt load.  
They also charge numerous fees (monitoring, advisory, transaction, restructuring) to the acquired company.

**Value Creation Tactics**  
"Creating value" for PE firms often involves drastic cost-cutting: mass layoffs, halting long-term investments, raising prices, squeezing suppliers, and delaying maintenance to boost short-term profits, potentially harming the company's long-term viability.

**Outcomes and Profitability**  
PE firms structure deals to profit in various scenarios:  
1.  **Successful Sale:** Company is improved and sold for a profit, allowing repayment of debt and generation of significant carried interest.  
2.  **Bankruptcy:** Even if the company fails, the PE firm often extracts more cash via dividend recaps and fees than its initial equity investment. Debt repayment obligations primarily fall to the bankrupt company.

**Case Studies**  
Examples illustrate practices:  
*   **Toys "R" Us:** Loaded with debt post-LBO, charged millions in fees, unable to invest, collapsed in 2017, costing 33,000 jobs.  
*   **Hahnemann Hospital:** Split into hospital and real estate entities; neglected the hospital, slashed staff, and prioritized selling the land, leading to closure and loss of care access.  
*   **ManorCare:** Loaded with debt, extracted dividends and fees, resulting in declining care quality and patient deaths before bankruptcy.  
*   **Macy's:** Split into retail and real estate; extracted high rent payments from the retail entity, contributing to retail collapse while real estate was sold separately.

**Motivation and Criticism**  
The author argues PE firms prioritize extracting maximum profits through fees and dividends, often at the expense of employee jobs, long-term health, and even customer/patient care, regardless of the company's ultimate fate. Their public claims of turnaround efforts are portrayed as a facade.
