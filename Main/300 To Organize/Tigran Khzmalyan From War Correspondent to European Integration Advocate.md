**Career Trajectory**
Tigran Khzmalyan began as a university professor of world culture and Russian literature in Yerevan. Witnessing the collapse of the USSR and the rise of the Karabakh movement, he shifted careers, enrolling in Moscow's Higher Directing Courses. The start of the Karabakh War in 1991 interrupted his film studies; returning to Armenia, he became a war correspondent for outlets like BBC, Reuters, and Vesti, leveraging his academic background over military service.

**Shift to Politics**
After the war, Khzmalyan returned to filmmaking, producing two feature films and later documentaries. Studio closures led him into civil and political activism. In 2018, he founded the European Party of Armenia (EPA), focusing on European integration. His involvement in politics has significantly reduced his film output.

**Historical Warning and Sardarapat Movement**
In 2008, Khzmalyan directed the banned documentary "Sardarapat. Déjà Vu," drawing parallels between the 1918 Armenian victory and subsequent loss of statehood. This inspired the 2009 "Sardarapat" movement, emphasizing historical resilience and the threat of repeating past mistakes. He views the film as a prescient warning largely unheeded by Armenia's political elite.

**View on Armenian Democracy**
Khzmalyan argues Armenia suffers from insufficient democracy despite formal freedoms. He criticizes the 2018 revolutionaries for repeating errors, noting financial disadvantages for new parties without oligarchic backing. He calls for bold democratic steps: a national referendum on strategic alignment (EU/NATO) and snap elections to overcome deep societal and parliamentary divisions.

**Armenia's Role and Mission**
Khzmalyan sees Armenia's political role as currently limited by its post-Soviet, "semi-colonial" status and lack of a cohesive national elite. He believes Armenia has a unique historical mission as a nation that has witnessed the rise and fall of numerous empires. He emphasizes the crucial need to integrate the Armenian diaspora for expertise and renewal.

**Path to European Integration**
Khzmalyan is convinced Armenia's future lies within the European family (EU and eventually NATO), facilitated by its diaspora. Key barriers include a society still "Sovietized," lacking respect for the rule of law and understanding that "strength is in law, not law in strength." He believes rapid economic and cultural revival is possible with European integration.

**Conflict Resolution Perspectives**
*   **Nagorno-Karabakh:** He cites the November 2023 ICJ ruling affirming Armenians' right to safe return as the legal basis. He enforces a solution within Azerbaijan's territorial integrity but with an internationally guaranteed Armenian autonomy.
*   **Turkey/Azerbaijan:** Relations can only normalize through adherence to international law: Recognition of the Armenian Genocide, Reparations (like Germany-Israel or US-Vietnam models), and Reconciliation. He notes Armenia has alternative partners like Iran and Georgia for European access.
*   **Israel-Palestine:** He supports a two-state solution, drawing parallels to events in Nagorno-Karabakh.

**Personal Goals & Future**
Khzmalyan's primary political goal is Armenia's full integration into the EU and NATO. Regarding Russia, he sees potential for a similar fate to the USSR, viewing current events as a tragedy primarily for the Russian people. While he has many film ideas, current political instability and the necessity of party work for Armenia's future leave cinema on hold.
