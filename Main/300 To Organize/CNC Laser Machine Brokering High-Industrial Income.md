Industrial Machinery Brokering Opportunity**
**Massive Market Gap**
Opportunity exists in a $500B+ industrial market for CNC laser machines, with demand far exceeding supply due to long lead times (months/years). Businesses are actively seeking solutions.

**Brokering Model**
Brokers act as intermediaries, connecting suppliers of high-demand CNC laser machines to buyers needing them. Work is done entirely online via introductions; no inventory handling or physical meetings required.

**Supplier Sourcing**
Use platforms like Apollo.ai to research machinery manufacturers. Target companies in machinery, industrial automation, manufacturing with revenue over $10M/year. Contact them via email expressing client acquisition interest.

**Buyer Targeting**
Identify decision-makers at end-user companies: CEOs/Founders, VPs of Sales/BizDev, Operations/Plant Managers, Procurement/Supply Chain. Focus on those needing CNC laser machines for assembly lines (e.g., Tesla, Boeing).

**Earnings Potential**
Brokers earn $10k-$25k upfront per deal plus 1-3% of the total transaction value. Average deals involve 10-25 machines at ~$500k each, yielding $50k-$100k+ per brokered transaction.

**Scaling the Business**
Build systems for repeat success: create a buyer database, hire VAs for lead scraping/outreach, utilize tools (Apollo, ChatGPT), implement monthly retainers for ongoing fees, transforming from broker to pipeline.

**Fulfillment**
Finding actual buyers is the final critical step. Specific outreach strategies are recommended (comment section referenced).
