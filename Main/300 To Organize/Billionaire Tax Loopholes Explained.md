Billionaire Tax Avoidance Examples**
Jeff Bezos (2007, 2011), Elon Musk (2018), and Warren Buffett paid little to no federal income tax.

**Key Tax Types**
*Income Tax*: Taxed on earnings; billionaires avoid by having no traditional income.
*Capital Gains Tax*: Tax on profits from selling assets (stocks, real estate, crypto). Short-term gains taxed as income; long-term gains taxed lower.
*Estate Tax*: Tax on assets passed to heirs after death.
*Corporate Tax*: Tax on business profits.
Other taxes (property, sales, payroll) are less relevant for billionaire avoidance.

**Primary Tax Avoidance Strategies**
**Asset Borrowing (Buy, Borrow, Die)**
Billionaires borrow against assets (e.g., stocks) instead of selling, avoiding capital gains tax. Interest is low and often tax-deductible. Assets continue appreciating. Upon death, heirs inherit assets with a "stepped-up basis" to current market value, eliminating capital gains tax.

**Charitable Donations of Appreciated Assets**
Donating appreciated stock/basis to a private foundation or donor-advised fund provides a full market-value tax deduction, avoiding capital gains tax on the appreciation. Donors maintain control over asset use, receive tax benefits, positive press, and can employ family/friends.

**Real Estate Depreciation & Cost Segregation**
Depreciation allows deductions for the declining value of buildings (27.5 years residential, 39 years commercial) against taxable income. Cost segregation accelerates deductions by breaking property components into shorter depreciation periods (5, 7, 15 years), increasing current tax savings.

**Low-Basis Compensation**
Billionaires (especially tech) take minimal salaries ($1/year) and are compensated with stock options/options. Selling held shares after >1 year qualifies for lower long-term capital gains rates (e.g., 20%) vs. higher income tax rates (e.g., 37%).

**Tax Loss Harvesting**
Selling investments at a loss realizes a capital loss, which can offset capital gains elsewhere, reducing the overall tax bill on profitable investments. The "wash sale" rule prevents repurchasing the same asset within 31 days to maintain the loss deduction.

**Offshoring Profits via Tax Havens**
Companies shift profits to low/no-tax jurisdictions (e.g., Cayman Islands, Ireland) using complex structures involving intellectual property licensing. US-based companies pay fees to foreign entities, reducing US taxable income. Profits remain offshore untaxed until repatriated.

**Conclusion on Legality**
These strategies are legal, utilizing existing tax code provisions. Billionaires leverage loopholes to significantly reduce or eliminate tax burdens while using US infrastructure and resources.
