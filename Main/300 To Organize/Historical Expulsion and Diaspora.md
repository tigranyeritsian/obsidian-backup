Historical Expulsion and Diaspora**  
Jewish roots trace back 4,000 years to Judea. In 135 CE, Rome suppressed a rebellion, expelled Jews, and renamed the province Syria Palaestina, influencing the term "Palestine." For 1,700 years, Jews lived globally, facing persecution, discrimination, and pogroms, particularly in Europe, where they were scapegoated.  

**Herzl’s Awakening**  
Theodor Herzl (1860–1904), a secular Jewish journalist, observed pervasive anti-Semitism, including the Dreyfus Affair (1894). In 1896, he published *Der Judenstaat* ("The Jewish State"), advocating for a Jewish homeland and founding political Zionism. He organized the first Zionist Congress (1897), prioritizing Palestine but considering alternatives like Argentina or Uganda.  

**Vision and Controversy**  
Herzl emphasized tolerance, aiming to protect non-Jews' rights and acquire land peacefully. His journal entries predicted a Jewish state within 50 years, realized in 1948. Despite debates over his legacy, his foresight and mobilization were pivotal. His novel *Altneuland* ("The Old New Land") promoted inclusivity, stating, "Man, you are my brother."
