**Sunk Cost Fallacy**  
Confusing past effort with current obligation. Continuing a miserable path won't refund past investments; it only compounds unhappiness. Quitting honors the effort by freeing oneself for alignment with present goals.  

**Confirmation Bias**  
Seeking information that validates existing beliefs while dismissing contradictory evidence. This creates echo chambers where repetition feels like truth. Clarity requires actively opposing views and questioning potential error.  

**Learned Helplessness**  
Perceiving repeated failure as permanent inability. Stopping attempts after setbacks creates imaginary mental cages. Escaping involves testing barriers again—failing forward to regain agency.  

**Gambler's Fallacy**  
Assuming random events balance past outcomes (e.g., "red must appear after five reds"). Past results don’t influence future randomness; the universe doesn’t owe fairness. Patterns in chaos are misperceived narratives.  

**Negativity Bias**  
Overemphasizing negative experiences while ignoring positive ones. Evolution wired brains for threat detection, causing disproportionate focus on criticism or failure. Counteract by intentionally acknowledging and recording positives.  

**Halo Effect**  
Judging overall worth based on a single positive trait (e.g., charisma implying competence). This shortcut blinds people to flaws or enables manipulation. Slow down and question assumptions beyond initial impressions.  

**Hyperbolic Discounting**  
Prioritizing immediate rewards over larger future gains. Present desires override long-term goals (e.g., "one more episode" over sleep). Mitigate by making future rewards feel tangible through visualization or traps.  

**Cognitive Dissonance**  
Mental tension from conflicting actions and self-perception. Resolved by justifying behavior (e.g., "I ghosted them because they were clingy") rather than changing actions. Awareness is key to aligning actions with desired identity.
