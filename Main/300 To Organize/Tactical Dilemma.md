Tactical Dilemma**  
The video shows Armenian forces deploying via trucks on open ground, raising questions about whether it depicts a failed attack or defensive troop movement.  

**Logistical Failures**  
Trucks blocked roads, concentrated troops in one spot, and lacked armored support, creating vulnerable targets for Azerbaijani drones.  

**Formation Analysis**  
Troops formed dispersed chains on open terrain, which is tactically sound if advancing under artillery cover but questionable without suppression of enemy fire.  

**Strategic Defensive Position**  
The deployment likely aimed to cover the southern flank of Armenia's counter-offensive, as the road runs east toward Azerbaijani advances threatening the Aghin corridor.  

**Conflict Dynamics**  
Armenia's weaknesses in reconnaissance, electronic warfare, and drone countermeasures hindered effective offensive operations. Expanding front lines may force Azerbaijan to divert troops to new territories, potentially benefiting Armenian defense.
