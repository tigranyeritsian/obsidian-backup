Emperor Hirohito's War Role**
Hirohito presided over Japan's aggressive expansion and atrocities during WWII. Modern evidence shows he was not a mere figurehead but actively enabled war crimes, including the Nanjing Massacre and Unit 731's human experiments, through his consent and directives. His divine status under State Shinto ideology fueled Japanese supremacy and obedience.

**Postwar Immunity and Historical Debate**
Despite Allied propaganda portraying Hirohito as a tyrant, the US shielded him from prosecution. General MacArthur deemed his prosecution destabilizing, leading to his immunity and the suppression of evidence implicating him or the Imperial Family. This fostered a narrative of him as a misled peacemaker, shaping his legacy for decades. Evidence destruction limits full understanding of his responsibility.

**Rommel's Gold: Fact and Legend**
SS units under Walter Rauff looted significant gold and valuables from Jewish communities in Tunisia during WWII retreat. Contemporary records confirm the theft. Evidence suggests the treasure was transported north and likely sunk off Corsica in 1943. The legend persists, fueled by SS man Walter Kerner's (later debunked) confession and searches like Ian Fleming's inspiration. Modern searches using sonar and magnetometry found nothing. The historical consensus holds the treasure likely remains sunk or was recovered secretly postwar.

**Eva Braun's Pregnancy Myth**
The claim Eva Braun was pregnant with Hitler's child originated from Hans Baur's 1945 Soviet interrogation and appeared in the "Hitler Book" dossier. No other witness confirmed this, and Baur omitted it in his memoirs. Historical consensus dismisses the myth due to lack of credible evidence: Hitler's will made no provision, his public persona rejected family ties, and their relationship was discreet. The claim is likely an interrogation fabrication.

**Yorkshire Cave Skeleton Mystery**
In 1947, cavers discovered a skeleton with a sodium cyanide bottle in a Yorkshire cave. The man, aged 25-30, died between 1941-1945. Cyanide fueled speculation he was a WWII spy, possibly parachuted into Britain. However, no evidence confirms this; missing German agent records don't match. Modern forensic techniques like DNA, isotopic analysis, and chemical testing could potentially solve the mystery.
