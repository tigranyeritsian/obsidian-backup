Fischer's Exile and Mother's Loss**
Bobby Fischer lived abroad in Europe and Asia for 12 years, missing his mother Regina's 1997 funeral. He was very close to her, and being unable to attend due to his fugitive status was devastating.

**Anti-Semitic Rants on Radio**
Fischer re-emerged publicly with virulent anti-American and anti-Semitic rants on Philippine radio, calling for the death of President Bush and the United States, and making horrific statements about Jews.

**Anti-Semitism as Psychopathic Illness**
Despite having a Jewish mother, Fischer rejected his Jewish identity. His anti-Semitism is described as a psychopathic illness and mindset, possibly stemming from hidden antagonism towards his parents.

**Paternity Revelation**
In 2002, it was discovered that Fischer's biological father was likely Paul Néni, a Hungarian physicist who died in the 1950s, not Gerhard Fischer who never lived in the US.

**Personality Parallels**
Bobby Fischer and Paul Néni shared remarkable physical resemblance and personality traits, including eccentricities and exceptional spatial reasoning abilities crucial for chess.

**Ironic Jewish Heritage**
Paul Néni was Jewish, whose life was destroyed by the Nazis. This meant Bobby Fischer, the world's most vocal anti-Semite, had two Jewish parents, creating profound irony.

**Debate on Resentment and Mental State**
The explanation for Fischer's resentment remains debated. Some view him as having lost his mind, while others describe him as simply becoming mean and bitter.
