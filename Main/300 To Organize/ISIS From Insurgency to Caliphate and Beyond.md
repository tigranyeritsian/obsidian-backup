The Rise and Fall of ISIS**

**Origins and Founding Leaders**
Emerging from Iraq, ISIS gained infamy through brutal actions: capturing cities, executing hostages, destroying heritage sites, and orchestrating attacks worldwide. Its founding leader was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian radicalized by Salafi jihadism in prison. He joined the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, later plotting against Jordan's monarchy. After meeting Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, Zarqawi fled to Iraq post-9/11, establishing a training camp.

**Evolution into AQI**
Following the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, Zarqawi pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda, renaming his group Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). He exploited Sunni-Shia sectarian tensions to destabilize the US-backed government, employing terror tactics against Shias and Sunnis alike. US efforts, including the 2006 killing of Zarqawi by Task Force 145, weakened AQI but didn't destroy it.

**Rise of Baghdadi and Formation of ISIS**
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi took command of the remnants in 2010. After the US withdrawal from Iraq in 2011, the new Shia-dominated government persecuted Sunnis, driving many towards AQI. Simultaneously, the Syrian Civil War (2011) created a power vacuum. AQI infiltrated Syria as the al-Nusra Front. In 2013, Baghdadi forcibly merged AQI and al-Nusra, creating the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), later the Islamic State (IS).

**Territorial Peak and Governance**
By mid-2014, ISIS controlled vast territory in Iraq and Syria, equivalent to Great Britain. It declared Baghdadi Caliph, aiming for a global caliphate. ISIS established a brutal theocratic government with a caliph, deputies, councils, and a harsh interpretation of Sharia law. Its economy relied heavily on oil smuggling, generating up to $1 million daily. It destroyed cultural heritage sites like Palmyra and committed atrocities against minorities like the Yazidis.

**Global Terror and Recruitment**
ISIS spread its ideology globally via the internet (magazines like Dabiq/Rumiyah) and social media, recruiting tens of thousands from 88 countries. It inspired or orchestrated attacks worldwide (Paris, Brussels, Orlando, Nice, Manchester, Istanbul, London) and recruited foreign fighters and child soldiers ("Cubs of the Caliphate").

**Decline and Collapse**
International coalition efforts (Operation Inherent Resolve) and local forces (Iraqi military, Syrian Democratic Forces - SDF) steadily eroded ISIS territory. Key defeats included the loss of Mosul (2017, including the destruction of the Al-Nuri Mosque minaret) and Raqqa (2017, its de facto capital). Baghdadi was killed in a US raid in 2019.

**Current Status**
ISIS lost its territorial caliphate but continues as a global terrorist network. In Syria and Iraq, it operates as an insurgency. Its offshoot ISIS-K is increasingly active in Afghanistan and has claimed recent major attacks (e.g., Moscow concert hall bombing).
