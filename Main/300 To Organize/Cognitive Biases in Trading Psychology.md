Cognitive Biases in Trading Psychology**  
**Origins of Cognitive Biases**  
Cognitive biases are systematic thinking errors occurring during information processing and decision-making. They arise from evolutionary adaptations to threats and neurophysiological constraints. The brain's fast "System 1" (instinctive) often overrides the slower, resource-intensive "System 2" (analytical), prioritizing speed over accuracy in uncertain environments.  

**Behavioral Economics Context**  
Traditional economics assumed rational decision-making, but behavioral economics (led by Kahneman and Thaler) recognizes humans as prone to fluctuations and poor risk assessment in uncertainty.  

**Key Biases in Trading**  
*   **Availability Heuristic:** Judging event likelihood by ease of recall. Amplified by vivid memories (e.g., witnessing a crash) or social media showcasing trading wins, leading to overestimating success probability.  
*   **Omission Bias:** Overvaluing active actions (opening a position) and undervaluing inaction (not opening it), causing missed opportunities. Repeating this creates a self-reinforcing cycle of avoidance. Mitigated by starting with small risk exposures (0.25%) to build responsibility.  
*   **Confirmation Bias & Belief Persistence:** Seeking information confirming existing beliefs and ignoring disconfirming evidence. Linked to ego protection and dopamine responses; challenging beliefs causes psychological pain. Mitigated by actively arguing the opposing viewpoint.  
*   **Baader-Meinhof Effect:** Perceiving newly encountered information as recurring. Requires statistical validation (e.g., backtesting new strategies) to avoid overvaluing novelty.  
*   **Hindsight Bias:** Viewing past events as easily predictable. Common when missing setups ("I knew it!"), often serving ego and control needs. Mitigated by focusing on process and defined trading times.  
*   **Gambler's Fallacy:** Assuming independent random events are connected (e.g., losses increase win probability). Leads to emotional trading. Mitigated by evaluating results in clusters (e.g., weekly performance) instead of individual trades.  
*   **Loss Aversion:** Feeling pain from losses more intensely than pleasure from equivalent gains. Causes early profit-taking and loss-holding. Mitigated by partial profit-taking (if planned) and avoiding market orders.  
*   **Hyperbolic Discounting:** Preferring smaller immediate rewards over larger delayed ones. Leads to impulsive market orders and premature exits. Combated with limit orders and building self-control.  

**Mitigation Strategies**  
Focus on trading system discipline, risk management, and cluster-based performance evaluation. Understanding biases helps, but deep-rooted evolutionary mechanisms make complete control difficult; consistent practice is key.
