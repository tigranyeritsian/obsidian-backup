**Book Selection**  
Choose books based on genuine personal interest and goals rather than trends or external pressure. Define what you want to know and who you want to become to narrow choices. Create a reading plan or follow existing curated lists.  

**Inspection**  
Dedicate 5–10 minutes to preview the book. Identify its genre (e.g., novel, non-fiction, memoir) and core purpose. Skim summaries, introductions, and conclusions to assess relevance and avoid wasting time on unsuitable material.  

**Note Taking**  
Actively engage with the text by writing directly in books or using a notebook. Selectively highlight impactful passages and annotate with personal reactions, questions, or connections to other ideas. Aim for depth over volume.  

**Analysis**  
Revisit annotations post-reading to develop insights. Use tools like Obsidian to compile quotes, paraphrase ideas, and expand on initial thoughts. Supplement with external research from credible sources if needed.  

**Archiving**  
Transform key insights into atomic notes (single ideas, 2–500 words). Focus on recurring themes, profound concepts, or personal reflections. Store all notes in a unified folder to enable cross-referencing.  

**Synthesis**  
Connect atomic notes from multiple sources to identify patterns, contradictions, and deeper insights. This reveals gaps in understanding and fosters a holistic knowledge base. Use search, tags, and graph views to manage connections.
