Interview Strategy**  
Agreeableness with empathy is key to revealing psychopathy in interviews, allowing nuances and inconsistencies to surface during questioning.

**Online Dynamics**  
Anonymity online enables disproportionate representation of psychopathic and manipulative behavior, as accountability is diminished.

**Audience Intelligence**  
The collective intelligence of viewers can detect psychopathic manipulation more effectively than interviewers alone, especially in long-form interviews where sustained performance becomes difficult.

**Psychopathy vs. Immaturity**  
Many extreme online trolls exhibit transient, developmentally immature behaviors rather than true psychopathy, with potential for growth.

**Censorship Dilemma**  
Censorship often empowers fringe ideologies by suggesting suppressed ideas hold truth, fueling persecution complexes and amplifying their reach.

**Behavioral Maturation**  
Most individuals exhibiting harmful traits desist by their late 20s due to natural maturation and increased conscientiousness, suggesting salvageability for many.

**Resource Limitations**  
True rehabilitation becomes improbable for those deeply entrenched in harmful patterns, requiring unsustainable resources to reverse significant behavioral decline.
