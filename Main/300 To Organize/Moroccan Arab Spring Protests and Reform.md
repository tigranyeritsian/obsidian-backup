Moroccan Context**  
Morocco presented an image of stability and economic growth (GDP per capita doubled, tourism boomed) but faced deep-seated issues: youth unemployment exceeding 30%, rising inequality, endemic corruption, and centralized power. The royal family and its business conglomerates controlled key sectors, while state media promoted a palace-led narrative and stifled dissent.

**Protest Catalysts**  
Inspired by Tunisia's uprising and Egypt's revolution, Moroccans organized online. Mohamed Bouazizi's self-immolation in Tunisia sparked calls for a "Dignity March" on February 20th, 2011, demanding "Dignity, Freedom, Social Justice."

**February 20th Movement**  
Thousands marched peacefully across over 50 towns, marking a rare public display of dissent. While largely non-violent, clashes occurred later in the day. The movement demanded systemic change: ending absolute monarchy, establishing parliamentary democracy, and dismantling corruption.

**State Response & Repression**  
Initial tolerance gave way to increasing repression. Security forces used excessive force, leading to injuries and deaths (e.g., protester Kamal Amari). Activists and journalists faced detention, trials, and media censorship (bans, ad boycotts). The state projected calm through subsidies and loyalist media campaigns.

**King's Reform Speech**  
On March 9th, 2011, King Mohammed VI announced constitutional reforms without explicitly acknowledging the protests. He outlined seven pillars: empowering the PM, judicial independence, decentralization, recognizing Amazigh identity, affirming freedoms/gender equality, and citizen participation.

**Constitutional Referendum**  
A new constitution was overwhelmingly approved (98%) on July 1st, 2011, amid an environment observers deemed not free (pressure on employees, state media dominance). It introduced changes: PM selected from the majority party, Amazigh as official language, human rights affirmation.

**Outcome & Limitations**  
The 2011 constitution maintained core monarchical powers (head of state, army, religion; control over strategic decisions). Reforms were criticized as top-down and ambiguous. While modernizing in language, the document preserved the traditional political structure and royal authority, offering limited substantive change.
