The Nationalism Paradox**  
**Nationalism's Ubiquity and Ambiguity**  
Nationalism dominates global politics yet lacks a clear definition. All modern regimes, even dictators, claim legitimacy through "the people" or "the nation."  

**Civic Nationalism's Flawed Foundation**  
Civic nationalism bases unity on voluntary agreement and shared values (e.g., French Revolution). However, enforcing "the general will" often leads to repression and violence (e.g., Reign of Terror).  

**The Failure of "The General Will"**  
Attempts to impose unity through a single ideology or state religion inevitably create schisms. Those dissenting are branded "enemies" and eliminated, demonstrating the inherent tyranny in such systems.  

**An Alternative: Emotional Resonance**  
True nationalism should stem from organic community bonds—shared culture, history, and empathy ("sympathy" as emotional resonance)—not imposed values. Like family, this is involuntary but fosters belonging.  

**Accepting Disagreement**  
Nations should be platforms for diverse values and interests, not enforcers of unanimity. Conflict is inevitable; the goal is peaceful coexistence, not forced consensus.  

**Rejecting Ideological Purity**  
Beware movements claiming to represent the "universal national interest." Such claims often mask authoritarian agendas and suppress dissent.  

**Conclusion: Nationalism Without Tyranny**  
Nations are necessary but must prioritize tolerance over enforced unity. Healthy nationalism allows individuality within a shared cultural framework, avoiding the "prickly hedgehogs" trap of conformity.
