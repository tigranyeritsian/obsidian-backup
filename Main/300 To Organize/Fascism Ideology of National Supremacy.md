Definition and Origins**  
Fascism is a political ideology centered on passionate, mystical nationalism that unites a nation and prioritizes its greatness above all else. It emerged in interwar Italy under Mussolini and Nazi Germany under Hitler, with influences including Gustave Le Bon's crowd psychology, Georges Sorel's revolutionary syndicalism, and Hegel's philosophy of the state as an embodiment of national spirit.  

**Core Ideas and Influences**  
Fascism rejects liberal individualism and class consciousness, advocating instead for mass politics and emotional mobilization. It draws from Hegel's belief that the state must subordinate individual interests to achieve national unity and historical purpose. Mussolini replaced class consciousness with national consciousness, creating a "myth of the nation" to inspire unwavering loyalty. Hitler similarly framed nationalism as a blood-based identity, demanding subordination to the "people and fatherland."  

**Key Characteristics**  
- **Totalitarianism**: The state holds absolute power over citizens, eliminating opposition and enforcing ideological conformity.  
- **Violence and Expansion**: Glorifies war as a unifying force and territorial expansion as a sign of national vitality.  
- **Pragmatic Economics**: Pursues hybrid policies (e.g., nationalizing industries while collaborating with big business) to serve state goals, not rigid ideological purity.  
- **Racial Purity (Nazism)**: Added eugenics and genocide, targeting groups like Jews to "purify" the nation, reflecting a twisted social Darwinism.  

**Practical Manifestations**  
In Italy, fascism remained largely theoretical, lacking full public buy-in and execution. Nazi Germany, however, successfully implemented fascism, using propaganda to indoctrinate the masses, reviving the economy, and pursuing aggressive expansion. The Nazis envisioned a "New Order" where Europe would be enslaved to Germany, with "inferior" races exterminated or subjugated.  

**Conclusion**  
Fascism is defined by its core principle: "We think with the blood of our nation" (Carl Popper). It demands surrender of critical thought to a collective national identity, prioritizing the nation's destiny through authoritarian control, emotional mobilization, and ruthless pragmatism.
