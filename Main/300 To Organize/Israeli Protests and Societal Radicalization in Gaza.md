Protests in Israel**  
Demonstrations focus on saving hostages and opposing Netanyahu's authoritarianism, not addressing Palestinian casualties.  
**The Gaza Situation**  
UN and experts describe actions as genocide or ethnic cleansing, with deliberate policies by Netanyahu's far-right government, including aid blocking and dehumanizing rhetoric.  
**Netanyahu as a Symptom**  
He is blamed for corruption and escalation but represents deeper societal issues, not the root cause of the conflict.  
**Societal Radicalization**  
Polls show 82% support deporting all Palestinians in Gaza, and nearly half endorse military actions akin to biblical massacres. Over 50% oppose humanitarian aid.  
**Contrasting Framing**  
Palestinians are labeled collectively responsible for Hamas, yet Israeli societal support for war crimes is similarly radicalized and unaddressed.  
**Historical Context**  
Decades of occupation, siege, and dehumanization in education/media/politics shaped this mindset, normalizing violence against Palestinians.  
**Minority Voices**  
Some Israelis and groups protest, but they lack influence on policy amid widespread support for military actions.  
**External Pressure Required**  
Change cannot come from within Israeli society due to consensus favoring ethnic cleansing; international intervention is necessary to address radicalization.
