**Pre-1967 Occupation Plans**  
Israel developed the Shakam plan (1963) to occupy the West Bank, building on experience from the 1956 Sinai Crisis and military rule over Palestinian citizens within Israel (1948-1966). Military governors and judges were pre-positioned in the West Bank and Gaza by 1967, with lawyers from the army and interior ministry shaping the plans.

**1967 Six-Day War**  
The war began on June 5, 1967. Israel rapidly defeated Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, capturing Gaza, the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), the Golan Heights, and Sinai. Despite initial hesitation from Prime Minister Eshkol and IDF Chief Rabin, Defense Minister Dayan and Central Front Commander Narkis pushed for and achieved the territorial expansion within two days.

**Christian Zionism Roots**  
Christian Zionist support for Israel predates the state, rooted in biblical interpretations (e.g., Brightman's 1585 work, Puritan "city on a hill" rhetoric). By the 1950s-60s, dispensational premillennial theology linked Jewish return to prophecy. This provided a fertile base for political lobbying, amplified by cultural products like Leon Uris's *Exodus* (1958).

**1967 US Policy Shift**  
US backing for Israel solidified under Johnson, who cited biblical affinity and frontier parallels. The American Zionist Emergency Council (AZEC, later AIPAC predecessor) built a massive lobbying infrastructure (400+ local committees), securing pro-Israel resolutions and overwhelming congressional support (86% Senate, 75% House endorsement for a Jewish state by 1944).

**1973 Yom Kippur War**  
Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack (Oct 6, 1973) to break the post-1967 deadlock. Despite initial losses, Israel counter-attacked. The conflict risked superpower confrontation after Israel violated a UN ceasefire, prompting a US nuclear alert. Israel suffered heavy casualties (2,838 dead), leading to Golda Meir's resignation.

**US-Israel Nuclear Complicity**  
The US secretly condoned Israel's nuclear program. By 1968, the CIA confirmed Israel had weapons capability. Nixon and Kissinger endorsed "nuclear opacity" (1969), halting US pressure on inspections and the Non-Proliferation Treaty in exchange for Israeli secrecy. Evidence suggested Israel illegally enriched uranium from a US plant (Apollo, PA).

**1975 Sinai Accords**  
Kissinger negotiated an Egyptian-Israeli disengagement agreement following the 1973 war. In return for partial Sinai withdrawal, Israel secured US pledges: no direct PLO negotiations, coordination on Geneva talks, and bilateral Arab-Israeli talks. These cemented US mediation dominance and Israeli influence on US policy.

**Lobby Impact**  
Pro-Israel groups like AIPAC and the Conference of Presidents mobilized intense pressure. They defeated the Rogers Plan (1969), secured massive aid ($500M+ post-1973), and retaliated against officials like William Rogers and Charles Percy (defeated after criticizing AIPAC tactics). Congress consistently prioritized Israeli security over broader US interests.

**Long-Term Consequences**  
US policy prioritized military aid and Israeli security over regional peace settlements, fueling Palestinian national mobilization (PLO recognition by Arab League/UN by 1974). The lobby influence and US complicity in nuclear opacity perpetuated occupation, settlements, and regional instability. Kissinger's "step-by-step" diplomacy and later Camp David further isolated the Palestinian cause.
