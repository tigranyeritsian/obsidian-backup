Religious and Cult Movements Overview**

**Tier 3: Niche Ideologies**
*   **Scientology:** Founded by L. Ron Hubbard, core belief involves humans as "thetans" created by alien Xenu. Known for celebrity members (e.g., Tom Cruise) and alleged abuse/cover-ups.
*   **Nation of Islam:** Fringe group promoting Black supremacy; believes white people are soulless experiments. Shares some values with mainstream Islam but is not representative.
*   **Christian Science:** Believes illness is an illusion curable by prayer alone; modern views allow medicine combined with prayer.
