The Origin Story**  
A 60-year-old Maryland-based hacker working for the NSA's elite Tailored Access Operations (TAO) unit secretly copied classified hacking tools to his personal computer in 2010 for practice. Over four years, he accumulated vast amounts of sensitive data on his home machine.  

**The Shadow Brokers' Leak**  
In August 2016, the anonymous group "Shadow Brokers" emerged on social media, auctioning NSA hacking tools via Bitcoin. After failed bids, they leaked the tools for free in 2017, including exploits like EternalBlue and frameworks like Dander Spritz. Their rants mixed conspiracy theories with direct taunts of U.S. officials and cybersecurity researchers.  

**Global Impact**  
The leaked tools enabled massive cyberattacks, including WannaCry and NotPetya (2017), causing billions in damages and disrupting critical infrastructure worldwide. They exposed NSA methods, damaged its capabilities, and empowered state and non-state actors globally.  

**NSA Aftermath**  
The NSA had to rebuild its entire hacking arsenal from scratch, setting operations back years. The incident forced a shift in vulnerability disclosure policies, moving away from "nobody but us" hoarding toward greater transparency to prevent future leaks.  

**Attribution Theories**  
Evidence ties the leak to Kaspersky antivirus detecting NSA tools on contractor Harold Martin’s and Fu Huangfa’s computers in 2014. Russian intelligence is widely suspected of acquiring the tools via Kaspersky, though the Shadow Brokers' exact identity remains unconfirmed. U.S. authorities believe state actors orchestrated the leak for geopolitical leverage.
