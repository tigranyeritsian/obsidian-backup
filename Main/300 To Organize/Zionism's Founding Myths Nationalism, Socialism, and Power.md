**Labor Movement's Socialist Facade**  
David Ben-Gurion consolidated power within the pre-state Jewish labor movement (Yishuv), using the kibbutz movement as a facade of pioneering socialism. Kibbutzim were idealized as egalitarian symbols of Zionist values but represented a tiny fraction of the Jewish population. Their image served to掩盖 (veil) a growing capitalist, urban, and unequal society. This facade functioned to raise funds and promote national solidarity, eliminating class friction to serve the primary goal of establishing a Jewish state.

**Nationalist Socialism in Zionism**  
Zionism is analyzed as a form of "nationalist socialism," where national aims superseded socialist principles. Ben-Gurion harnessed private capital for Zionist ends if it employed Jewish workers and rejected class conflict, prioritizing national interests. He declared class interests identical to national interests, aiming to transform the Yishuv into a "working nation." This ideology prioritized land conquest and state-building over universal socialist values.

**Ideological Cross-Currents**  
Early Zionist thought incorporated European nationalist concepts of race and "blood and soil." Figures like Moses Hess defined Jewish identity racially. Martin Buber's communitarian philosophy was misused by Nazis for racial theories. Arthur Rupin, a key Zionist figure, engaged with Nazi racial theorists like Hans Günther and participated in the Transfer Agreement with Nazi Germany, facilitating Jewish immigration and capital transfer. German Zionists echoed Nazi racial purity concepts to justify their position.

**Institutional Realities**  
Rupin directed Zionist colonization efforts in Palestine, described as the "father of Zionist national settlement." The Transfer Agreement (1933-1941) was crucial for Palestine's economy, funneling significant capital from German Jews. Jabotinsky's "Iron Wall" doctrine prevailed, advocating forceful colonization against the native population, stating it could only proceed behind an "iron wall" of military protection. The King-Crane Commission (1919) warned that Zionist aims would require dispossession of Palestinians and likely force, contrary to Balfour Declaration promises.

**Historical Context**  
During WWII, the Yishuv leadership prioritized state-building over rescuing European Jews. Memos from the Jewish Agency's rescue committee argued for saving only those deemed useful to the Yishuv, viewing purely philanthropic rescue as damaging. The memory of the Holocaust was later weaponized by Israel to deflect criticism and justify policies. Critics like Zeev Sternhell and Tom Segev highlight the Yishuv's instrumental view of Diaspora Jews and the Holocaust's political exploitation.

**Contemporary Implications**  
Sternhell and others draw parallels between early Israeli nationalism and European fascism, warning of rising racism and dehumanization of Palestinians in Israel. Historians like Benny Morris and Amos Goldberg assert Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, citing mass displacement, destruction of infrastructure, killing of civilians, and genocidal rhetoric from officials. They argue genocide involves destroying a group's collective existence, not just physical extermination, and point to historical precedents like the Armenian genocide and Rohingya persecution.
