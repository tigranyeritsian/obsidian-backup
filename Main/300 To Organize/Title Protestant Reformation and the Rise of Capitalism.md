Title**: Protestant Reformation and the Rise of Capitalism  
**Tags**: Protestantism, Catholicism, Theology, Capitalism, Anxiety, Double Predestination, Orthodoxy, Justification by Faith, Justification by Works, Social Hierarchy  

**Catholicism Core Tenets**  
- **Orthodoxy/Dogma**: Fixed beliefs requiring memorization without interpretation.  
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Priests and the pope mediate access to God and the Bible, controlling religious authority.  
- **Justification by Works**: Salvation depends on rituals and obedience, prioritizing actions over faith.  

**Protestant Reformation Responses**  
- **Direct Access to God**: Believers read the Bible personally, eliminating priestly intermediation.  
- **Egalitarianism**: All believers equal before God, rejecting hierarchical control.  
- **Justification by Faith**: Salvation demands sincere belief and personal struggle with divine grace.  

**Problems with Protestantism**  
- **Existential Anxiety**: Uncertainty about true faith leads to self-doubt and compulsive verification.  
- **Religious Fragmentation**: Egalitarianism spawns countless denominations, weakening unified doctrine.  
- **Literacy Barrier**: Education requirement excludes the poor, attracting mostly the middle class.  

**Theological Challenges**  
- **Holy Trinity**: An incomprehensible contradiction causing anxiety when directly confronted.  
- **Obsessive Behavior**: Anxiety drives attempts to rationalize and order the physical world.  
- **Double Predestination**: Calvinist doctrine that only the elect (those who believe they are saved) will be saved, exacerbating insecurity.  

**Money as a Solution**  
- **Standardization**: Money simplifies diverse values into a coherent system, reducing confusion.  
- **Symbolic Conflation**: Money replaces God as a measurable symbol of faith and predestination.  
- **Capitalist Ethic**: Wealth accumulation becomes proof of divine favor, creating a system where money is worshipped as reality itself.  

**Modern Legacy**  
- Capitalism emerges as a secularized Protestant ethic, prioritizing wealth accumulation over religious devotion.  
- Contemporary society internalizes this mentality, exemplified by figures like Jeff Bezos, despite declining religious belief.  
- Economic structures persist as a psychological and cultural framework shaped by historical anxieties.
