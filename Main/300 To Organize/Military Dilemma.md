Military Dilemma**  
Facing a fortified city like Mariupol, an advancing army must choose between blockading it while continuing forward, launching a full assault, or attempting both simultaneously. No universal solution exists.

**Blockade Challenges**  
Blockading a modern city requires significant forces (7-15k troops for Mariupol) due to multiple escape routes (roads, sea) and the need to protect supply lines beyond artillery range. Blockading forces risk being overextended if the garrison conducts a breakout with armored vehicles. Resources are diverted from the main offensive.

**Assault Advantages**  
A full assault, while time-consuming and resource-intensive, eliminates the threat from the city, protects supply lines, and avoids spreading forces thin. It is seen as the more reliable "second option," concentrating sufficient power for success.

**Historical Parallels**  
The Franco-Prussian War illustrates the problem: Russian forces stalled due to sieging multiple fortresses, halting maneuver warfare for months. Repeating this scenario risks depleting offensive strength for large-scale battles.

**Russian Strategy**  
Russia chose to storm Mariupol early, reflecting a prioritization of reliability and commitment to the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). This decision, however, constrained offensive tempo elsewhere on the front (e.g., towards Kramatorsk/Slavyansk) due to resource limitations.

**Political Context**  
Storming Mariupol fulfills obligations under the friendship treaty with the DPR. Russia has not aimed to occupy territory beyond Luhansk/Donetsk, explaining the initial focus on these regions and the subsequent formation of military-civil administrations elsewhere (e.g., Kherson).
