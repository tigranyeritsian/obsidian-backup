The Orthodox Origin Story**
Money traditionally begins with barter, requiring a double coincidence of wants. Societies evolved to use gold as a medium of exchange, reducing transaction costs. Depositing gold with goldsmiths led to paper receipts, which became early bank money through fractional reserve banking.

**Critique of the Orthodox View**
This story lacks historical evidence; barter-based economies are not found in ancient records. Money pre-existed markets and writing, which was initially used for accounting. Authorities, not individuals, created monetary systems. Modern and ancient money lacks intrinsic value, relying on trust or authority. The Orthodox story fails to explain money's origins or its entry into the economy.

**Alternative Origins: Wergild**
Money likely originated from tribal "wergild" traditions, where fines for injuries (e.g., a cow for killing) established standardized values. This concept of valuation evolved into money units, often based on grain weights (shekel, pound). Authorities (e.g., temples) set value equivalencies.

**Alternative Nature of Money**
Money is a state monopoly and social unit of account. The state defines the currency unit (e.g., dollar). Money records are hierarchies of IOUs denominated in the state unit. Physical form (coin, paper, electronic) is technological, not fundamental. Value stems from the state's power, especially its taxing authority, not intrinsic value. Currency itself is a debt record and promise of redemption.

**The State's Central Role**
Money evolution has always involved the state. The "one nation, one currency" rule is the norm, tied to sovereignty and fiscal power. Exceptions (like the Euro) are rare and often problematic. Taxation is the key sovereign power that gives money value.
