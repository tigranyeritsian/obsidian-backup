**The Nature of Nonverbal Communication**
Nonverbal communication, often called body language, encompasses appearance, posture, movement, and micro-behaviors. It's fundamental to how we understand others and is heavily used in contexts like security and social interaction.

**Debunking Common Myths**
Myths like crossed arms indicating defensiveness or nose/mouth touching indicating lying are inaccurate. Such actions are often self-soothing behaviors, not reliable deception indicators. Humans are generally poor at spotting lies.

**Navarro's FBI Experience & Approach**
Navarro, a 25-year FBI agent specializing in counterintelligence, emphasizes that understanding nonverbal cues is crucial for security and assessment. Behavior is key, not confessions. He focuses on observable behaviors to assess information transmitted, regardless of external factors.

**Detailed Observation Methodology**
Navarro systematically observes specific areas:
*   **Hair & Face**: Health, grooming, forehead stress lines, eye redness, glabella (space between brows) for stress cues.
*   **Eyes & Lips**: Redness, lip compression, lip biting (nervousness), tongue-in-cheek (soothing/manipulation attempt).
*   **Neck & Shoulders**: Neck tilt (relaxation vs. problem onset), shoulder shrugging (uncertainty).
*   **Hands & Fingers**: Finger pressing/splaying ("teepee" - anxiety), hand wringing, slow hand movements (soothing), akimbo posture (territory marking), thumbs-forward (interest), neck ventilation (distress).
*   **Legs & Feet**: Leg crossing (potential threat feeling), leg rubbing (soothing), foot fidgeting (discomfort).
*   **Movement**: Gait, pace, stride, sidewalk vs. street walking, blink rate, clock-watching.
*   **First Impressions**: Handshakes provide crucial chemical/comfort information. Personal space is vital for comfort; its adjustment affects interaction dynamics.

**Application: Poker Tells**
Navarro applies nonverbal analysis to poker:
*   Initial observations at the table reveal discomfort indicators.
*   Hand placement over cards (protecting value) or away from the table (dislike) signals investment level.
*   Chip shuffling is self-soothing, not necessarily deception.
*   Posture changes (uncrossing arms, hands moving forward) indicate increased engagement.
*   Increased head movement or gesturing can signal discomfort or distraction.
*   Observing others' reactions when looking away from cards can provide insights.

**Core Principle: Assessment, Not Judgment**
The goal of nonverbal analysis is to assess what a person is transmitting *in the moment*, not to pass judgment. Most critical information (70-80%) is observable through behavior. While a "poker face" might be possible, a "poker body" is not; behaviors reveal underlying states. Nonverbal communication is primary and pervasive in human interaction.
