**Post-Revolutionary Chaos and Ottoman Threat**  
The Russian Revolution (1917) left Transcaucasia vulnerable after Russian military successes against the Ottomans during WWI. The region experienced "Balkanization," fragmenting from Russia into warring districts. Despite Armenian reluctance, Transcaucasia declared independence to face the Ottoman advance.

**Formation of the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic (TDFR)**  
The TDFR was proclaimed in April 1918, attempting unity against the Ottomans. However, internal divisions were immediate. Armenians resisted fiercely around Kars, while Georgians were more conciliatory. Ottoman forces rapidly seized Batum, exposing Georgian military weakness and disloyalty among Muslim populations.

**The Critical Fall of Kars**  
Prime Minister Akaki Chkhenkeli, mandated to seek peace, secretly ordered the Armenian garrison at Kars to evacuate without a fight. This unilateral decision, hidden from Armenian leaders, caused outrage. Ottoman demands were met, but the chaotic surrender of Kars on April 25-26, 1918, led to its swift capture, massive refugee influx, and Armenian accusations of betrayal against the Georgian-led government.

**Diplomatic Efforts and German Intervention**  
Peace talks in Batum stalled due to Ottoman maximalist demands and deep mistrust among national delegations. Germany, seeing economic importance in Transcaucasia's resources and seeking to limit Ottoman ambitions, offered mediation. However, German support proved unreliable, and its eventual withdrawal signaled the TDFR's imminent collapse.

**The Dissolution of the Federation**  
By late May 1918, the TDFR's dissolution was inevitable. Georgians, securing German protection, prioritized their survival. On May 26, 1918, the Transcaucasian Seym (parliament) voted to dissolve itself, citing irreconcilable differences and lack of unified authority. Georgia declared independence the same day, securing German recognition. Azerbaijan followed soon after.

**Armenia's Path to Independence**  
Caught off guard by the federation's collapse, Armenian leaders initially blamed Georgians. Facing utter isolation, they declared the Republic of Armenia on May 28, 1918, though its formal declaration and international recognition came later, achieved through desperate military resistance and the subsequent Treaty of Batum.
