Introduction**  
Investment banking involves grueling 100-hour weeks fueled by caffeine and stress for the chance of high earnings. Bankers act as dealmakers in mergers, acquisitions, IPOs, and financing, taking significant fees. While compensation is lucrative, the job demands extreme sacrifices.

**Role & Responsibilities**  
Investment bankers are not stock traders. They structure major deals: M&A (negotiating valuations, fees), IPOs (setting share values), debt/equity financing (raising capital), and financial advisory (high-priced consulting for CEOs). Companies rely on their expertise for high-stakes decisions.

**Compensation Structure**  
Salaries start high: Analyst ($100k-$150k), Associate ($150k-$250k), VP ($250k-$400k), Managing Director (>$400k). Bonuses, often 50-200% of salary, are the real wealth driver, reaching seven figures for MDs based on individual performance, deal flow, firm success, and relationships.

**Income Sources**  
Banks earn massive fees: 1-2% on M&A deals (e.g., $100-$200M on a $10B deal), 5-7% on IPOs (e.g., $50-$70M on $1B raised), and 0.5-1% on financing. These fees fund the high compensation structure.

**Job Demands**  
Workweeks are 80-100 hours, often overnight. Junior staff are on call 24/7, sleep under desks, and face intense pressure for perfection. Mistakes in models or presentations carry severe consequences in a "sink-or-swim" environment.

**Burnout Risks**  
The job causes severe stress, isolation, and health issues (anxiety, depression, hypertension). Most analysts quit within 2-3 years due to unsustainable workloads. Layoffs are common during market downturns, and bonuses can shrink drastically.

**Career Exits**  
Common paths include Private Equity (buy/sell companies, 60-80 hours, higher pay), Hedge Funds (trading, high risk/reward), Corporate Finance (CFO roles, better hours), and Entrepreneurship/VC (building/investing in startups). Former bankers remain financially successful but face the trade-off of past sacrifices.
