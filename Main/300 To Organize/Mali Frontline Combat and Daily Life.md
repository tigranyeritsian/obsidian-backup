Deployment Context**  
Soldiers operate in Mali under Operation Barkhane, fighting terrorist groups for seven years. Extreme temperatures (50°C) and desert terrain dominate the environment, with bases fortified against threats.  

**Daily Routines**  
Base life involves sandstorms, water rationing, vehicle maintenance, and security rotations. Soldiers adapt to heat, limited internet (2G), and unique wildlife (scorpions, solifugae). Quarantine protocols and power constraints disrupt routines.  

**Convoy Duties**  
Sappers and infantry escort convoys, checking roads for IEDs. They manage traffic, clear obstacles, and conduct patrols. Toyota vehicles are common; breakdowns and sand crossings pose challenges.  

**Combat Engagements**  
Firefights occur during village searches and ambushes. Troops use machine guns (M2 Browning, MAG) and test civilians for explosive residue. Hostile groups include jihadists and bandits; seized vehicles are investigated.  

**Base Life**  
Gao base serves as a logistics hub with international forces. Activities include vehicle repairs, training (metal detectors, chemical tests), and cultural interactions. Local markets and religious sites are observed during patrols.  

**Conclusion**  
After months in Mali, soldiers depart via C-160 and C-130 Hercules. In Bamako, protests erupt following France’s withdrawal, with displays of Russian and anti-French sentiment. The mission ends with aircraft inspections before returning to France.
