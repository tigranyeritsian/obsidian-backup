Plot Setup**
The film begins with hunter Llewellyn Moss discovering a drug deal gone wrong in West Texas. He finds a truckload of heroin and $2.4 million in cash. Deciding to take the money to improve his life with his wife Carla Jean, Moss sets off a chain reaction.

**Chase Structure**
Two primary drives propel the narrative: Moss flees with the money pursued by the cartel seeking it; Sheriff Ed Tom Bell simultaneously pursues both, disturbed by the escalating violence and disruption of peace.

**Setting Significance**
The West Texas desert is a crucial character â€“ a primitive, survivalist landscape that shapes the story and its themes of endurance. The Coen brothers emphasize the location's authenticity and its inextricable link to the narrative.

**Casting Process**
Casting was meticulous. Tommy Lee Jones was the immediate choice for Sheriff Bell. Finding Moss and Carla Jean proved harder; the Coens sought rugged authenticity. Josh Brolin's in-person reading convinced them. Javier Bardem's initial tape was noted for lighting, but his live audition secured the role of Anton Chigurh.

**Character Portrayals**
*   **Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones):** A decent, capable "salt of the earth" figure representing the past and overwhelmed by modern violence. His dreams haunt him.
*   **Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin):** A resourceful Vietnam veteran, motivated by love for his wife, caught in extraordinary circumstances. His death by random violence underscores the story's themes.
*   **Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem):** A psychopathic hitman embodying fate and violence. His physicality (bad haircut) and coin toss ritual create menace. He operates on a personal, almost supernatural code, remaining largely unknowable.
*   **Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald):** Moss's wife, highlighting his motivations. Her confrontation with Chigurh is pivotal.

**Themes and Symbolism**
The film explores fate (symbolized by Chigurh's coin), the arbitrary and violent nature of the world, the passage of time, and the struggle to understand and survive in a hostile landscape. It subverts genre expectations, particularly with Moss's abrupt death.

**Creative Process**
The Coen brothers adapted Cormac McCarthy's novel, drawn to its "pulpy" yet profound nature and subversiveness. They work collaboratively in the same room, choosing ideas expressible cinematically. They see themselves as "the same person with two heads," directing actors effectively while maintaining shyness.
