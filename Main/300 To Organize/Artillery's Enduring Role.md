Artillery's Enduring Role**  
Traditional artillery remains crucial for neutralizing enemy defenses during ground offensives, especially when neutralizing observation and fire control is sufficient, unlike total destruction. Drones assist in isolation but cannot replace artillery's direct support for advancing troops.

**Azerbaijan's Offensive Dynamics**  
Azerbaijan's initial advance, including significant gains in mountainous terrain and open plains, demonstrates its reliance on conventional forces alongside drones. Success hinges on effective coordination between artillery, armor, and infantry, which was initially problematic but improved later.

**Armenian Defenses Reality Check**  
Armenian fortifications in Nagorno-Karabakh are described as well-developed field defenses over 25 years, comparable to standard military lines, not "Maginot Line" structures. They lack reinforced concrete but incorporate extensive trench networks and supply routes.

**Artillery Doctrine in Practice**  
Artillery preparation focuses on disrupting enemy observation and fire control using smoke and earth-raising projectiles, following specific rates (e.g., one smoke shell per minute per 100m frontage), adjusted for wind conditions. Techniques like rolling barrages target enemy positions selectively.

**Terrain Misconceptions**  
Claims of impassable mountain terrain hindering movement are overstated. Major fighting occurred on open, accessible plains near Madagiz and southern zones, with good road networks. Mountains only constrained northern advances slightly.

**Warfare Evolution**  
The conflict shifted from attempted blitzkrieg to positional attrition due to initial coordination failures. Azerbaijan now relies on material superiority—drone tech, larger budget, and manpower—to gradually wear down Armenian defenses, framing slow progress as deliberate strategy.

**Political Timings**  
Speed is critical to seize territory before international powers (US, EU, Russia, Iran) intervene decisively. Early momentum allows Azerbaijan to present facts on the ground, limiting diplomatic options for Armenia.

**Broader Implications**  
The war highlights Clausewitz's principle—war as politics by other means. Increasing internationalization (foreign fighters, external aid) and drone integration mark modern warfare, but conventional force execution remains decisive.
