**Embassy Strike as Act of War**
Israeli airstrike on Iranian embassy in Damascus on April 1st killed seven people, including two commanders, marking an unprecedented intentional attack on sovereign territory.

**Military Superiority**
US and Israel demonstrate clear dominance over Iran through superior technology and intelligence. The strike showcased precision, hitting only the Iranian embassy despite proximity to the Canadian embassy. Intelligence capability, combining signals (electronic surveillance) and human sources, enabled targeting of commanders.

**Iran's Response**
Iran retaliated with "Operation True Promise," launching 300 drones and missiles at Israel.

**Operation True Promise Interception Claims**
Israel claims 99% were intercepted using its Iron Dome system, demonstrating its defensive capabilities. Iran asserts the attack was intentionally designed to be minimally damaging as a strategic choice.

**Iranian Strategy**
Iran's response highlights strategic necessity due to US/Israeli military dominance. However, dominance does not guarantee victory in a potential escalating conflict leading to a ground invasion.

**Asymmetric Warfare Concept**
Iran's potential advantage lies in asymmetric warfare. This involves exploiting knowledge of terrain and using unconventional tactics (like drone swarms) to offset technological inferiority, controlling the terms of engagement.

**Millennium Challenge Simulation**
A 2002 US military simulation (Team USA vs. Team Iran) demonstrated Iran's potential to win despite overwhelming US power. Iran employed asymmetric tactics (e.g., suicide boats against aircraft carriers), exploiting cost asymmetry ($20 million in drones vs. $1 billion carrier) to achieve strategic success.

**Inflexibility of Dominant Powers**
The US "won" only in a second simulation after scripting the scenario and disallowing asymmetric tactics, revealing inflexibility. Empires like the US suffer from hubris and bureaucracy, refusing innovative tactics, making them vulnerable to asymmetric strategies that exploit their rigidity and high-cost assets.
