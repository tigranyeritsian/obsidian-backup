KGB Tactics in Modern Negotiations**

**Nerve Massage**
Involves detailing horrific future consequences (execution, prison, family harm) to instill paralyzing fear. Used in interrogations and business to pressure concessions through threat of loss (money, relationships). Requires psychological blocking techniques.

**Hedgehog Gloves**
Named after NKVD head Yezhov, this tactic uses relentless, round-the-clock interrogation by constantly changing interrogators. Causes extreme exhaustion, leading victims to confess to anything. Applied in modern business via exhausting negotiation "conveyor belts."

**Standing Torture**
A physical torture forcing victims to stand unsupported on one leg for 10-12 hours, causing unbearable pain and submission. Not applicable in business, but demonstrates extreme psychological pressure methods.

**Lightning Decision**
Forces targets to make immediate decisions ("Sign or leave now") under duress, eliminating time for rational thought. Exploits fear and emotional overwhelm, leading to self-damaging agreements. Taking a pause is a crucial countermeasure.

**Twisting Facts**
Manipulates words and statements to create false implications or accusations. Examples include misinterpreting "acquaintance" as "intimate relationship" or "correspondence" as "spying." Requires immediate clarification ("I said X, not Y") to prevent false narratives.
