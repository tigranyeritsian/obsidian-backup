Global Financial Crisis and China's Growth**  
The 2008 global economic collapse spurred central banks to encourage China's money printing. This investment in real estate (requiring resources from Australia/Brazil) created apparent prosperity but masked underlying issues: massive debt (future generations' burden), severe inequality (rich vs. poor), and political corruption.

**The "American Strategy" Historical Parallel**  
America allegedly convinced Japan in 1985 to increase its yen's value, leading to economic collapse. Similarly, America encouraging China's money printing (c. 2008/2015) created conditions for China's future economic crisis, enabling the rise of its current leader who aims to save China from dependency on the global financial system.

**Putin's Grand Strategy and Resource Control**  
Putin sees America's global economic pyramid (resources at base, finance at top) as fundamentally weak. Controlling resources (oil, food) allows inverting this pyramid. Invading Ukraine aimed to dominate global grain production, strangling rivals. Revealing America's military vulnerability forces the US to invade Iran to restore dollar faith, though Iran's mountainous terrain makes victory unlikely.

**Iran Invasion, US Dollar Dominance, and Israel-Palestine**  
Invading Iran would control Middle East oil and global trade, securing Japan's dollar purchases (vital for the US economy). The Israel-Palestine conflict provides a pretext for an Iran invasion, surrounded by US bases for 20 years. This invasion risks ending the American Empire.

**Putin's Counter-Strategy and Future Alliances**  
Putin's mutual defense pact with Kim Jong Un creates a potential Korean conflict to divert US forces if Iran is invaded. Geopolitical realities (China/Russia border disputes, Central Asian rivalry) will fracture their alliance. Predicted realignments: US-China reconciliation due to economic interdependency, and a Germany-Russia partnership. Trump's push for a third term drives actions to solve the $37 trillion national debt via military dominance and forcing China's economic opening to create more US dollar dependency.
