Conventional Money Origins Story**  
Robinson Crusoe barter requires double coincidence of wants. Evolution selects gold as medium of exchange due to value and durability. Storing gold with goldsmiths leads to receipts circulating as money. Goldsmiths realize partial reserves suffice, creating deposit expansion and the banking system. Money supply is exogenous, controlled by central banks via reserves or interest rates to manage inflation.

**Problems with Orthodox View**  
- No historical evidence of barter-based economies; money pre-dates markets.  
- Authorities always involved in monetary systems.  
- Modern money lacks intrinsic value; "trust" arguments are weak.  
- Circular flow diagrams fail to explain money's origin.  

**Alternative Money Origins**  
Money likely emerged from tribal "wer-geld" (injury fines) as a social measure of value. Early money units (shekel, pound) derived from grain weight standards. Authorities (temples, states) set value equivalences. Money is a **state monopoly**: a unit of account, denominated in state currency, recorded via evolving technology (tallies, coins, cash, digital).  

**Value and Redemption**  
Currency value stems from state power to impose taxes and obligations ("taxes drive money"). Taxes create demand for currency, which is "redeemed" (returned to issuer upon payment). Colonial examples (Virginia notes, Yap stones) show taxes transform objects into money. Fiat money is valuable due to state promises to accept it for tax payments.  

**Nature of Money**  
Money is **credit/debt**: all money is an IOU denominated in state currency. Issuers (state, banks) must accept their own liabilities. Sovereignty includes the power to name money and define obligations. Redemption occurs when debts are returned to the issuer; creation precedes redemption.  

**Government Spending Mechanics**  
Complex modern systems exist (banks, central banks, tax accounts), but core logic remains: government must spend or lend reserves before taxes can be paid. Spending creates financial wealth; sectoral balances matter.  

**Policy Implications**  
- Sovereign governments cannot run out of their own currency; keystrokes create money.  
- Affordability depends on real resources (full employment), not "running out."  
- Inflation arises from excessive spending relative to capacity, not deficits per se.  
- Hyperinflations stem from supply collapses (e.g., war reparations, Zimbabwe's agriculture), not deficits.  
- Deficit spending can target unemployment but requires taxes/controls near capacity.  
- Government size is inherent to capitalist economies; debt levels are manageable.  
- Social Security affordability depends on productive capacity growth, not intergenerational transfers.  

**Debunking Myths**  
- "We're out of money" narratives are false political tools.  
- Government bonds are not "taxpayer money"; they reserve liabilities.  
- Bitcoin â‰  money; money requires state/social acceptance.  
- Debt-free money is impossible; money is inherently credit relations.
