Toxic Waste Dumping Incident**
Trafigura hired Compagnie Tommy to illegally dump 500 tonnes of hazardous waste in Abidjan for $17,000 after being charged $620,000 in the Netherlands. The dumping caused severe health impacts and panic among residents due to the country's weak regulation and post-crisis vulnerability.

**The "Ivorian Miracle" (1960s-1970s)**
Ivory Coast achieved Africa's highest GDP per capita ($3,055 by 1978) via export-led growth in cocoa/coffee/tea, averaging 7.3% annual growth. This success was unique in Sub-Saharan Africa at the time.

**FHB's Governance Model**
President Felix Houphouët-Boigny (FHB) maintained a French-aligned, single-party state. He retained colonial administrators, prioritized agriculture, encouraged immigrant labor ("The land belongs to the person who develops it"), and secured favorable trade agreements with France, attracting significant investment.

**Economic Collapse (1980s Onward)**
The model collapsed due to plummeting global coffee/cocoa prices and a critical flaw: the Bank for Stabilization of Prices and Agriculture (BSPA) functioned as a corrupt state revenue tool. Funds were looted, leading to massive debt. By 2011, GDP per capita had halved since 1978.

**Political Instability and Civil War**
FHB's death in 1993 triggered succession crises. Ethnic tensions, xenophobia ("Ivoirité"), and military coups culminated in two devastating civil wars (2002-2007, 2010-2011) driven by flawed elections and power struggles.

**Current Economic Resurgence (2012-Present)**
Under President Ouattara, the economy has grown an average 7% annually (2012-2023). Key factors include diversification (services now >50% of GDP), attracting private investment, and infrastructure development. GDP per capita ($2,900) is the highest in West Africa (excl. Cape Verde).

**Challenges and Risks**
Youth unemployment is low (5%), but skills gaps persist due to war. Heavy reliance on oil/gas exploration raises sustainability concerns. The biggest threat is political: Ouattara, 83, won a third term illegally and may seek a fourth term without a clear successor, risking instability.
