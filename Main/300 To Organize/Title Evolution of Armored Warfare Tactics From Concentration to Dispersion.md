Title**: Evolution of Armored Warfare Tactics: From Concentration to Dispersion  
**Tags**: armored warfare, military tactics, reconnaissance, Nagorno-Karabakh, drone warfare, command and control  

**19th Century Foundations**  
Military strategy evolved from single-army advances to multi-army concentric attacks using railroads and telegraphs to coordinate dispersed forces. Infantry dispersion increased with rifled weapons, stretching battlefronts beyond commanders' direct observation.  

**World War II Mechanization**  
Tanks enabled large-scale envelopment at the operational level. Radio and air reconnaissance centralized command but required constant concentration of armored forces ("tank fists") for breakthroughs, supported by motorized infantry to prevent dispersal.  

**Cold War Nuclear Deterrent**  
Nuclear weapons forced dispersal at all levels to avoid annihilation. Armored units concentrated only briefly for specific tasks, shifting to rapid, continuous movement ("advance without halt") to minimize exposure. Motorization increased, reducing reliance on slow-moving infantry divisions.  

**Modern Reconnaissance Challenges**  
Enhanced detection (drones, signals intelligence, satellite surveillance) negates passive concealment. Standing armor becomes vulnerable; continuous movement is essential to evade detection, but concentration remains necessary for breakthroughs.  

**Nagorno-Karabakh Lessons**  
Armenian counter-attacks failed due to slow movement under drone surveillance. Modern tactics demand either:  
- **Dispersed Forces**: Reliance on speed and coordination to mask intentions, increasing electronic signature vulnerability.  
- **Concentrated Forces**: Easier command and air defense coverage, but higher risk of detection during assembly.  

**Conclusion**  
No universal solution exists. Tactics depend on reconnaissance capabilities, air defense assets, and threat levels. Active countermeasures (EW, air defense) supersede passive concealment. Armored forces remain vital but require adaptive dispersion/concentration balance to survive modern battlefield transparency.
