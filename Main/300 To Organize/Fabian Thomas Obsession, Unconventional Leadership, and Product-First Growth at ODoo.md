Obsession & Philosophy**  
Fabian Thomas emphasizes that obsession is non-negotiable for success. He prioritizes building transformative software over money, rejecting short-term valuation goals. His vision commoditizes business software, making it affordable and integrated like Microsoft Office.  

**Early Ventures & Founding ODoo**  
Started his first business at 13 with management software. Built diverse ventures (T-shirts, antivirus, art marketplace) before founding ODoo at 26. Purchased sorry.com in 2006, believing he would surpass competitors. ODoo began as a "fat startup" tackling complex business problems holistically.  

**Business Model Pivots**  
Initially struggled with a service-heavy model, nearly facing bankruptcy. Pivoted to open-source maintenance, then to open-core (80% free, 20% paid) to sustain revenue. Prioritized product development over early monetization, leading to 50% annual growth.  

**Unconventional Management**  
Rejects traditional hierarchiesâ€”no VPs, team leaders, or recurring meetings. Focuses on team autonomy, responsibility, and on-the-job training. Uses IQ tests and practical assessments for hiring, not resumes. Maintains a young average team age (26) by promoting internally.  

**Growth & Scaling**  
Scaled to 5,000 employees globally by relocating top talent to strategic locations (e.g., India, Buffalo). Avoids tier-one cities to reduce turnover. Grew from 16 to 800 clients/month in India through hands-on leadership. Prioritizes product and culture over budgets and KPIs.  

**Pricing Strategy**  
Experimented with pricing early, facing partner pushback. Later reduced prices for small clients during inflation, boosting acquisition by 2.8x. Believes low prices drive commoditization, not revenue maximization.  

**Competition & Disruption**  
Views ODoo as category-defying, not competitive. Focuses on creating an integrated, affordable suite versus fragmented competitors (e.g., Salesforce, SAP). Plans to displace SAP in large enterprises through superior UX and efficiency.  

**Leadership & Culture**  
Spends 50% of time on product development. Rejects IPOs to maintain long-term focus and avoid quarterly pressures. Maintains 57% ownership, using secondaries for liquidity without ceding control. Believes culture trumps processes; teams self-organize without formal oversight.  

**Future Vision**  
Aims to dominate business software by solving complexity, like OS/Office evolution. Prioritizes AI integration where it solves real problems, not as a gimmick. Continues scaling without defocusing, emphasizing relentless product innovation.
