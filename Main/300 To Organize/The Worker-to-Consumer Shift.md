Marx's Unexpected Influence**
Marx's ideas about workers creating value were implemented in post-WWII Europe and the US, creating a worker-centric society despite communism not occurring as he predicted. This period saw strong worker protections and a focus on improving the middle and working classes.

**The Peak of the Worker-Centric Society**
The decades following WWII saw societies prioritize workers as the central economic unit. Workers gained political power through unions, leading to policies like excellent healthcare, public schools, and affordable universities, significantly benefiting the working and middle classes.

**The Elite Revolt of the 1980s**
Starting in the 1980s, a shift occurred driven by elites seeking greater inequality and power. This "revolt of the elite," exemplified by Reaganism in the US and Thatcherism in the UK, moved society away from worker focus towards neoliberalism and free-market capitalism. CEO pay exploded relative to worker pay during this transition.

**The Shift to Consumerism**
Society transitioned from organizing around the "worker" to the "consumer." The government promise shifted from guaranteeing a good job to offering low prices and wide selection of goods. This change aimed to dismantle the working class's collective political power.

**Consumerism as the Perfection of Slavery**
Consumerism fosters competition for prestige (e.g., social media status), leading to debt and isolation. It encourages individuals to view the world through an economic lens, prioritizing personal consumption over collective action and solidarity. This system, argued to be the "perfection of slavery," creates a populace that willingly embraces its own oppression, unaware and unwilling to rebel, potentially representing the "end of history."
