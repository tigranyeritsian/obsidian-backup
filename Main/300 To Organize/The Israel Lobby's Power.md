The Israel Lobby's Power**  
APAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, is a highly influential lobbying group on Capitol Hill that shapes US legislation affecting Israel. It operates from headquarters but restricts access and claims to spearhead pro-Israel support without being a political action committee.

**Debunking Key Myths**  
1. **Strategic Asset**: Israel was not a reliable Cold War counterweight to Soviet influence, and its actions (e.g., the 1982 Lebanon invasion that created Hezbollah) often destabilized the region. The Soviet collapse ended this justification.  
2. **Terrorism Partner**: US support for Israel motivates anti-American terrorism, evidenced by figures like Ramzi Yousef and Osama bin Laden explicitly citing it as a reason for attacks.  
3. **Democracy**: Israel is not a true democracy, as Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza lack voting rights despite Israeli control, and Palestinian citizens face systemic discrimination. Policies favoring Jewish demographics contradict democratic principles.  
4. **Existential Threat**: Historical records show Israel was militarily superior in 1948 and 1967, and Arab states never sought its destruction. Israel is now the Middle East's fourth most powerful military with nuclear weapons.  

**Historical Context of US Aid**  
US-Israel relations strengthened after the 1967 war, with military aid skyrocketing from $63 million/year (1949-1965) to $634 million by 1971. Israel became the largest US aid recipient by 1976, receiving preferential terms like full annual aid upfront and exemptions to use aid for domestic defense industries.  

**APAC's Lobbying Tactics**  
APAC grooms congressional candidates through briefings and position papers, ensuring alignment with its agenda. It punishes dissenters, as seen when Representative Ilhan Omar criticized APAC and faced bipartisan condemnation and calls to resign. APAC mobilizes supporters to pressure lawmakers and influences media through think tanks and editorial boards.  

**Consequences of Influence**  
The lobby ensures unconditional US military aid ($3+ billion/year) and diplomatic cover for Israel, enabling actions like the Gaza invasion with impunity. It shapes foreign policy away from broader US interests, alienating the Muslim world and strengthening adversaries like Iran.
