**Thomas De Quincey's Innovation**
De Quincey's "Confessions of an English Opium-Eater" is a groundbreaking 1821 memoir, focusing on his addiction to explore the inner self and psyche ("the apocalypse of the world within me"). He aimed to challenge typical autobiographies by revealing the "ugly parts" of character and his sufferings, contrasting with the usual emphasis on success.

**Contrast with Earlier Autobiographies**
Prior works, like St. Augustine's "Confessions," focused on external rules, divine will, or societal roles. The Ancients lacked the concept of personality, seeing emotions as imposed externally by gods. Traditional knowledge was exogenous (outward-looking), not endogenous (inward-focused).

**Philosophical Shift: The Rise of the Inner Self**
A major shift occurred in the 18th century with Rousseau, who argued truth must be found within the self ("the first modern man"). Writers like Goethe ("turned into himself and found a world") and Wordsworth (writing "The Prelude" about the growth of a poet's mind) emphasized the inner life as shaped by individual experience and perception, making the ordinary extraordinary through personal feeling.

**De Quincey's Literary Techniques**
De Quincey admired Wordsworth and moved to Dove Cottage. He adapted Wordsworth's exploration of emotion and the self to his own dark urban experiences and addiction, using vivid metaphors (oceans, mirrors, staircases) to describe his inner turmoil and the "endless self-multiplication" of his psyche. He claimed his work was unprecedented.

**Scientific and Cultural Impact**
This inward gaze mirrored scientific developments (like Galileo's observations) and laid foundations for modern psychology. The autobiographical self, building on memories and orienting towards the future (as per Kai Wang), became central to modern culture and politics, influencing arguments for individual rights and democracy. However, it also fostered the modern narcissism and self-obsession prevalent today.

**The Modern Challenge**
The core challenge of this century is reconciling "the world within" with "the world without."
