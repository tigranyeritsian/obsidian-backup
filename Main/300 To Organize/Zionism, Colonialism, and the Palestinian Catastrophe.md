Biblical Foundations**
The Jewish narrative originates in the Torah, describing God's covenant with Abraham and the promised land of Canaan. This story forms the basis for Jewish national identity and connection to Israel, though lacking significant external historical corroboration.

**European Persecution and Anti-Semitism**
Centuries of Christian Europe defined itself against Judaism, portraying Jews as Christ-killers and demonic figures. Jews faced forced conversions, expulsions, ghettos, and were confined to professions like money-lending. The 19th century saw the rise of racial anti-Semitism, depicting Jews as a subversive, dangerous race.

**Zionism's Emergence**
Theodor Herzl's 1896 pamphlet "Der Judenstaat" proposed a Jewish state in Palestine as a solution to European anti-Semitism. Zionism framed this as a Western outpost against "barbarism," aligning with colonialist tropes. Crucially, it gained traction among European leaders as a way to remove Jews from Europe.

**British Colonial Role and the Balfour Declaration**
Britain, motivated by imperial interests and Christian Zionism, issued the 1917 Balfour Declaration, endorsing a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine while ignoring the Arab majority. This facilitated Zionist colonization.

**Settler Colonialism and Palestinian Resistance**
Zionist immigrants established separate communities and economies, funded by European elites. This sparked immediate Palestinian resistance recognizing it as colonization. Figures like Jabotinsky advocated an "Iron Wall" of force to achieve maximalist aims.

**The Nakba (1948) and Denial**
Israel's founding in 1948 involved the forced displacement of 750,000 Palestinians (the Nakba) and massacres. The Holocaust's uniqueness was enshrined in international law, creating a hierarchy where Israel, perceived as Holocaust survivors, gained moral impunity, necessitating Nakba denial.

**Post-1948 Israel and the Occupation**
Following the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel occupied Gaza, the West Bank, and the Golan Heights. Israel solidified ties with the US, framed as a Western/Judeo-Christian ally. The occupation became central to Israeli policy, with settlement expansion and repression intensifying.

**Racial Hierarchies and Internal Tensions**
Israel developed a racial hierarchy privileging Ashkenazi (European) Jews over Mizrahi (Arab-world) Jews, who were forcibly "de-Arabized" and treated as a labor underclass. Post-1967, Palestinians became the "enemy within."

**Right-Ward Shift and Extremism**
The 1973 war discredited the Labor Party. Likud, led by Begin (a Jabotinsky disciple), came to power, stoking Mizrahi resentment against both Palestinian Arabs and the Ashkenazi elite. Rabbi Meir Kahana's Kach party, advocating transfer of Arabs, exemplified rising extremism.

**Netanyahu and the "Greater Israel" Project**
Benjamin Netanyahu, a Jabotinsky disciple, embodies the policy of imperial force and maximalist territorial goals ("Greater Israel"). Settlement building in the West Bank has destroyed the possibility of a viable Palestinian state.

**October 7th and Gaza War**
The October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks led to Israel declaring total war on Gaza. Israel's response has involved flattening Gaza, targeting civilians and infrastructure. Accusations of genocide and crimes against humanity have been made by international bodies.

**International Impunity and Cracks**
The post-WWII international legal system was structured to grant Israel impunity, particularly regarding genocide. However, proceedings at the ICJ and ICC seeking arrest warrants for Israeli leaders signal unprecedented cracks in this impunity, driven by global south solidarity.
