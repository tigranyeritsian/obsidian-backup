Azerbaijan's Military Primacy**
Azerbaijan's southern offensive near the Iranian border represents primary military success, enabling gradual territorial gains. Political gains like improved negotiation leverage are secondary bonuses. Attacks toward Stepanakert remain costly and stalled, making southern advances strategically preferable. Operations stretch Azerbaijani forces but align with their attrition strategy leveraging superior resources and time.

**Armenia's Defensive Dilemma**
Armenian forces prioritize defending Stepanakert's approaches, leaving southern regions secondary. Retreat towards the Armenian border is likely, potentially resupplying via Armenia. This exposes vulnerabilities but may reduce drone/ artillery supply line threats from Karabakh.

**Geographical Constraints & Attrition**
Mountainous terrain south of the Lachin Corridor offers natural defensive lines but favors Azerbaijani infiltration. Front length increases Azerbaijani logistical burdens. Southern advances are slow (45-50km in weeks), indicating a war of attrition rather than blitzkrieg. A key defensive potential lies near the Armenian border's protrusion, potentially shortening the front.

**Geopolitical Context & Future Risks**
Global focus on COVID-19 and US elections hinders decisive international intervention. Stalled regional negotiations grant Azerbaijan time. Azerbaijani forces approaching the Armenian border risk escalation, especially if Armenian territory is used for supply or attacks. North and south advances are possible as Armenian forces weaken, but a full invasion of Armenia seems unlikely unless conflict spirals further.
