Crisis Indicators**  
Chinese consumers spend less, the housing sector downturns, deflation persists, youth unemployment remains high, and government stimulus fails to boost spending.

**Industrial Boom**  
China achieved the second-fastest major economy growth rate, dominating advanced industries like electric vehicles, clean tech, and AI. Industrial production expands despite consumer weakness.

**Unique State Intervention**  
Unlike Japan or the West after housing bubbles, China's state-owned banks massively redirected lending from real estate to strategic industries post-burst, fueling unprecedented industrial growth and export dominance.

**Export Dependency**  
Domestic deflation and weak consumer demand force reliance on foreign markets, leading to export surges but increasing protectionist backlash globally (e.g., Brazil, India, Indonesia).

**Debt Risks**  
Debt-to-GDP ratio rapidly rises again (approaching US levels) due to state-backed industrial lending. While lower than Japan's, this model is unsustainable, especially with a declining working-age population. The government officially aims for consumption-based growth but hasn't acted on it.
