History of Western Philosophy**

**Ancient Philosophy**
*   Originated in Ancient Greece, shifting from myth to rational inquiry.
*   Pre-Socratics (Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes, Pythagoras, Democritus) sought the fundamental substance (water, apeiron, air, numbers, atoms) of the cosmos (naturophilosophy).
*   Socrates initiated the "anthropological turn," focusing on ethics, self-knowledge, and dialectic.
*   Plato founded the Academy, asserting the existence of a separate realm of perfect Forms (universals) and an ideal state ruled by philosopher-kings.
*   Aristotle, Plato's student, emphasized empirical observation, logic, and categorizing knowledge. He critiqued Plato's Forms, prioritizing individual substances and developing theories of the soul and politics.
*   Late Antiquity saw the rise of Epicureanism (pursuit of ataraxia), Stoicism (virtue and acceptance), Skepticism (doubt), and Neoplatonism (Plotinus, mystical union with the One).

**Medieval Philosophy**
*   Dominated by Christian theology (Patristic and Scholasticism).
*   Patristics (e.g., Augustine) integrated Christian doctrine with Platonic thought, emphasizing divine creation, original sin, and inwardness for truth.
*   Scholasticism (e.g., Thomas Aquinas) sought rational proofs for faith, synthesizing Aristotelian philosophy with theology. Aquinas's Five Ways argued for God's existence.
*   Philosophy served as a "handmaiden to theology," aiming to understand and defend Christian doctrine.

**Renaissance and Early Modern Philosophy**
*   Renaissance rediscovered classical texts and humanism, shifting focus to human potential and nature (e.g., Nicholas of Cusa, Copernicus, Bruno).
*   Francis Bacon promoted empiricism ("knowledge is power") and identified idols hindering truth.
*   Thomas Hobbs developed social contract theory and advocated for absolute sovereignty (Leviathan).
*   René Descartes emphasized rationalism ("I think, therefore I am"), dualism (mind/matter), and methodological doubt.
*   Baruch Spinoza proposed pantheism (God/Nature) and determinism.
*   John Locke developed empiricism ("tabula rasa"), social contract, and liberalism.
*   Leibniz proposed monadology and pre-established harmony.

**Modern Philosophy**
*   Immanuel Kant synthesized rationalism and empiricism, distinguishing phenomena (appearances) and noumena (things-in-themselves). His Categorical Imperative guided ethics.
*   Johann Gottlieb Fichte emphasized the primacy of the "I" in subjective idealism.
*   G.W.F. Hegel developed absolute idealism, dialectics (thesis-antithesis-synthesis), and the idea of historical progress towards freedom via the World Spirit.
*   Ludwig Feuerbach critiqued religion as anthropomorphism, shifting focus to human nature.
*   Arthur Schopenhauer viewed the world driven by blind Will, advocating art and asceticism as relief.
*   Friedrich Nietzsche proclaimed "God is dead," the "Will to Power," the "Übermensch," and critiqued "slave morality."
*   Karl Marx developed historical materialism and class struggle theory, advocating proletarian revolution and communism. Vladimir Lenin adapted Marxism for revolution in Russia.
