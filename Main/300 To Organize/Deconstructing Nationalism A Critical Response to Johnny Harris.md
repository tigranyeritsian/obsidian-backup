Deconstructing Nationalism: A Critical Response to Johnny Harris**

**Core Disagreement**
The author respectfully disagrees with Johnny Harris's argument that nations are "completely made up" and a recent invention, while acknowledging Harris's valuable contributions.

**Nationalism as Myth**
Harris presents nationalism as based on several myths: genetic/ethnic basis, requirement for common language, recent invention, and artificial nature that undermines legitimacy.

**Ethnic and Linguistic Foundations**
The author agrees nations lack genetic basis and historically had linguistic diversity but counters with examples like Switzerland and Canada showing multiple languages don't preclude national identity.

**Historical Origins**
Challenges Harris's claim that national identity is entirely recent, citing evidence of English national identity emerging as early as the 1300s through coins, poems, and popular culture.

**Reality of Constructs**
Questions framing nations as not "real," arguing they have tangible foundations in shared history, geography, and cultureâ€”similar to months relating to lunar cycles.

**Thick vs. Thin Nationalism**
Distinguishes between "thick" nationalism as political ideology potentially leading to conflict, and "thin" nationalism as cultural identity that can be benign and inclusive.

**Ethnocultural vs. Civic Nationalism**
Contrasts ethnocultural nationalism (exclusive, based on ethnicity) with civic nationalism (inclusive, based on citizenship), suggesting the latter offers a more positive model.

**Alternative Systems**
Examines cosmopolitanism but finds it problematic as a political system, potentially leading to concentration of power. Questions whether any alternative identity system avoids group dynamics that can lead to conflict.

**The Left and Nationalism**
Argues the left shouldn't dismiss nationalism entirely, noting its historical role in decolonization, anti-racist movements, and as solidarity source for marginalized groups.

**Conclusion**
Maintains national identity doesn't necessarily lead to conflict, can be civic rather than ethnic, and provides valuable social cohesion in modern, atomized societies.
