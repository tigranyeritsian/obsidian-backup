Dialogue Technique**  
The author describes an interaction with a complaining police officer who criticizes "rotten intelligentsence." Instead of offering guidance, the author suggests directing the external complaint into an internal dialogue by asking targeted questions exposing contradictions in the complainer's statements.  

**Cognitive Dissonance**  
By asking the complainer to define antonyms for his emotionally charged labels (e.g., "rotten" vs. "fresh"), the technique forces him into a logical contradiction. He struggles to articulate the opposing concept, leading to silence and internal reflection about the disconnect between emotional evaluations and objective reality.  

**Emotional Adaptation**  
The text concludes by quoting Fritz Perls, stating that emotions are essential adaptations to situations, enabling effective action.
