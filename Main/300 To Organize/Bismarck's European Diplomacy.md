Bismarck's European Diplomacy**

**German Unification and Consequences**
*   Germany unified under Prussian leadership in 1871, ending Austro-Prussian rivalry.
*   Unification achieved through three wars: Denmark (1864), Austria (1866), France (1870-71).
*   French defeat was humiliating; Alsace-Lorraine annexed, creating lasting enmity.
*   Germany became a major power in a multipolar Europe with France, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Britain.

**Bismarck's Foreign Policy Goals**
*   Post-unification focus: consolidate gains, integrate minorities, build institutions, expand industry.
*   Primary objective: maintain European peace to avoid wars damaging Germany's interests.
*   Strategy: sophisticated alliance-building to prevent encirclement and isolate France.
*   Fear: a Franco-Russian-Austrian-Hungarian alliance surrounding Germany.

**The Three Emperors League**
*   Formal alliance (1873) between Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia.
*   Aimed to isolate France and Britain; suppressed Polish nationalism and socialism.
*   Strategic logic: Germany isolated France; Russia isolated Britain (Great Game competition).
*   Critical weakness: conflicting Austro-Russian interests in the Balkans.

**The Balkan Crisis and Congress of Berlin**
*   Balkan uprisings against Ottoman rule (1875-76) threatened regional stability.
*   Bismarck pressured Austria and Russia to negotiate to avoid conflict between them.
*   Reichenbach Agreement (1876): Austria-Hungary to annex Bosnia-Herzegovina; Russia annex Bessarabia; Bulgaria autonomous.
*   Russia declared war on Ottoman Empire (1877); Austria secured neutrality.
*   Treaty of San Stefano (1878): Created large, independent Bulgaria, angering Austria, Britain, and others.
*   Congress of Berlin (1878): Revised treaty, shrinking Bulgaria, denying Russia Mediterranean access, confirming Austrian gains in Bosnia.
*   Outcome: Bismarck acted as "honest broker" but alienated Russia; Three Emperors League dissolved.

**Alliance System and Dissolution**
*   Bismarck prioritized Austria-Hungary as a central power sharing Germany's vulnerability to encirclement.
*   Preserving Austria-Hungary was crucial for German security and Prussian dominance.
*   Compromising with Russia (e.g., accepting a larger Bulgaria) was seen as a dangerous slippery slope threatening Austria-Hungary and German position.
*   Result: Formed Dual Alliance (1879), Triple Alliance (1881), and Reinsurance Treaty (1887) with Russia.
*   This complex system collapsed after Kaiser Wilhelm II dismissed Bismarck.
