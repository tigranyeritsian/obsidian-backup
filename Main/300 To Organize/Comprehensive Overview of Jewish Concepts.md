**Prophecy of Messiah**  
Describes signs preceding the Messiah's arrival: increased impudence, high costs, heretical monarchy, corrupted study halls, destroyed Galilee, desolate Gavlan, border wanderers seeking charity, despised righteous, absent truth, familial disrespect, and reliance solely on God.

**Torah Cantillation (Trope)**

**13 Principles of Faith**  
Maimonides' fundamental Jewish beliefs: God's existence, unity, incorporeality, eternity, exclusive worship, prophecy, Moses' primacy, Torah's divine origin, immutability, God's omniscience/providence, divine reward/punishment, Messiah's arrival, and resurrection of the dead.

**Six Remembrances**  
Daily prayer elements recalling: the Exodus, Revelation at Sinai, Amalek's attack, Golden Calf, Miriam's punishment, and the Sabbath's holiness.

**Demons in Judaism**

**Repentance (Teshuvah)**  
Fundamental concept enabling sin correction through regret (often verbal) and decisive behavioral change, proven by avoiding the original sin's circumstances.

**Aaron the High Priest**  
Moses's brother and first High Priest. Performed first three plagues, known for peace-making efforts and deep love, mourned more than Moses upon his death.

**Satan's Trick (Golden Calf)**  
Satan caused Moses's funeral casket image to appear above Mount Sinai, convincing the panicked Israelites Moses died, leading to the Golden Calf sin. The Israelites' miscalculation (counting day 1 of Moses's absence as day 40) contributed to their panic.

**Hillel and the Convert**
