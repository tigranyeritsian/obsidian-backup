Turkey's Economic Crisis Context**  
Turkey faces severe hyperinflation and currency devaluation, with prices doubling annually. The Turkish Lira has lost over 80% of its value against the dollar in five years, drastically reducing purchasing power for locals and tourists alike.

**Skyrocketing Prices**  
Basic costs surged: a meal costing $2.80 in 2021 now exceeds $10. Rent in cities like Istanbul tripled (from 2,000-3,000 Lira to 15,000+ Lira monthly). Essentials like bread and olive oil became unaffordable for many on fixed incomes.

**Currency Collapse**  
The Lira plummeted from 4.5 Lira/$ in 2018 to nearly 40 Lira/$. The 200-Lira note (worth $35 in 2019) is now worth only $5. Imposed interest rate cuts worsened inflation, peaking at 85% in 2022 and remaining above 50%.

**Policy Failures**  
President Erdoğan’s unorthodox policies—cutting rates despite high inflation—eroded central bank independence. Investor confidence collapsed, credit ratings dropped to "junk," and foreign investment plunged by 38% since 2015.

**Devastating Local Impact**  
Minimum wages (22,000 Lira/month ≈ $560) fail to cover basic needs. Shortages emerged, and professionals (e.g., doctors, engineers) emigrate en masse, fueling a brain drain. Many families struggle with heating and overcrowded housing.

**Tourism Challenges**  
Tourism (12% of GDP) previously thrived on affordability but is now strained. Despite a strong dollar, tourists face high local prices. Euro charges in resorts and reduced bookings signal declining competitiveness.

**Current Stabilization Efforts**  
Aggressive rate hikes (to 45%+) slightly stabilized the Lira and slowed inflation, but damage persists. Savings were wiped out, and recovery will take years due to shattered trust and systemic economic fragility.
