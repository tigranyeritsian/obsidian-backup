France's Early Dominance**  
Louis XIV established absolute monarchy, making France Europe's demographic, military, and economic powerhouse by 1700. Its population was 50% larger than any rival, with cutting-edge military innovations and an economy twice the size of others. This alarmed European powers, leading to repeated Grand Alliance coalitions to contain French expansion.

**War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714)**  
The war began to prevent a union of Spanish and French thrones under Louis XIV's grandson. France employed a "mixed war" strategy initially, conquering territories but was defeated at Blenheim. Despite Philip V retaining the Spanish throne, the treaty forbade future unifications. The war bankrupted France, crippling its economy and military, ending its bid for continental hegemony.

**Decline and Rivalry with Britain**  
France's financial struggles continued through the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), where it lost most North American colonies to Britain. Supporting the American Revolution achieved revenge but bankrupted France, triggering the 1789 Revolution. Despite political upheaval, revolutionary meritocracy enabled significant military gains.

**Napoleon's Brief Hegemony**  
Napoleon's coup in 1799 exploited revolutionary military reforms. His innovative tactics conquered most of continental Europe by 1811, establishing the First French Empire. However, global control was impossible due to British naval supremacy at Trafalgar and financial backing of coalitions. The Continental System failed, and prolonged wars drained French resources.

**Final Outcome**  
Napoleon's defeat in 1814 ended French hegemony. France suffered massive casualties (6 million dead, a third French) and political instability in the 19th century. Britain, avoiding France's mistakes, established the largest empire and the Pax Britannica, leading to a "British century" instead of the predicted French one.
