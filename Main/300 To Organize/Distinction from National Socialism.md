Distinction from National Socialism**  
Fascism and national socialism are fundamentally different ideologies. Fascism, rooted in Giovanni Gentile's actual idealism, rejects biological racism. In contrast, national socialism is inherently racist. Historical evidence shows Italian fascists protected Jews (e.g., Margherita Sarfati, 10,000 Jewish party members, refusal to deport Jews to Nazi camps). Anti-Semitism in fascism was religious, not biological, and allowed conversion, unlike Nazi racial determinism.  

**Philosophical Foundations**  
Fascism is based on actual idealism, the philosophy that human consciousness creates reality. Developed by Gentile, it holds that the external world is a product of the mind ("mind over matter"). This idealism underpins collectivism: individuals find fulfillment only by merging with the state, which embodies the universal "manness." Reality is shaped through collective action, making materialism and determinism untenable.  

**Historical Context**  
Original Italian fascism (pre-1938) was not biologically racist. Mussolini had a Jewish mistress, and Jews held positions in the party. The *Doctrine of Fascism* (1932) omitted racism. Racial laws (1938) were religious-based and exempted converts; no Jews were murdered. Fascism's anti-Semitism emerged later under Nazi influence but remained distinct from Nazi biological racism.  

**Democracy and Totalitarianism**  
Fascism frames the state as a spiritual entity where "state and individual are inseparable." It claims to be "democracy par excellence" because the collective will (via consciousness) forms the state. This synthesis demands total immersion, rejecting individualism. The corporate state mediiates class conflicts, aiming for an ethical, cooperative society.  

**Third Position Ideology**  
Fascism is a "third position" beyond left/right, combining nationalism, syndicalism (trade unionism), and actual idealism. It rejects capitalism, Marxism, and conservatism. Its totalitarian nature stems from the belief that the state is the manifestation of universal truth, requiring absolute alignment of the individual will with the collective.  

**Media Misrepresentation**  
Mainstream media conflates fascism with national socialism and the far right. This stems from language barriers and Marxist/Soviet propaganda. The AfD and other groups are not necessarily fascist, lacking the core tenets of actual idealism. Understanding fascism's true basis is vital to combat its appeal, as its ideas resonate with those valuing collective action and spiritual unity.
