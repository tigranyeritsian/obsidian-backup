Title**  
Dark Empaths vs. Psychopaths: Key Traits  

**Definition**  
Dark empaths possess high cognitive empathy but lack emotional or compassionate empathy. They exhibit dark traits like narcissism, psychopathy, and machiavellianism, distinguishing them from both full empaths and psychopaths.  

**Emotional Display**  
Dark empaths show emotions (often feigned) to manipulate, unlike psychopaths, who lack emotional capacity entirely.  

**Empathy Levels**  
Dark empaths use cognitive empathy to understand and exploit others’ feelings, while psychopaths act without regard for others’ emotions.  

**Strategic Patience**  
Dark empaths plan and bide time for manipulation, contrasting with psychopaths’ impulsivity.  

**Calculated Behavior**  
Dark empaths maintain a trustworthy image to exploit others, while psychopaths engage in reckless, remorseless actions.  

**Sociability**  
Dark empaths are extroverted and socially adept, whereas psychopaths display antisocial behavior.  

**Professional Diagnosis**  
Self-diagnosis is unreliable; consult a mental health professional for accurate assessment of these traits.
