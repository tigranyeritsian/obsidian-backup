Truman's Recognition Decision**  
In May 1948, President Harry Truman faced fierce opposition from Secretary of State George Marshall and the State Department ("Wise Men") against recognizing Israel. Domestic adviser Clark Clifford argued for recognition based on political, humanitarian, and biblical grounds. Marshall threatened to vote against Truman if he followed Clifford's advice. Truman overruled Marshall, recognizing Israel on May 14, 1948.

**Emergence of the Israel Lobby**  
The Biltmore Program (1942) marked the birth of the American Zionist movement, later formalized as the American Zionist Emergency Council (AZEC). Lobbyists like Isaiah Kenan pressured Congress and the White House. Truman's sympathies for Jewish Holocaust survivors and biblical beliefs influenced his decision, though State Department memos warned against yielding to Zionist pressures, citing U.S. strategic interests in the Arab world.

**1948-1963: Early Conflicts and Aggression**  
Israel's Plan D (1948) led to the displacement of 750,000 Palestinians. Post-war, Israel rejected U.N. resolutions on refugees and territorial boundaries, lobbying the U.S. to override diplomatic pressure. The Eisenhower administration faced Israeli aggression (e.g., Qibya massacre, 1953; Samu raid, 1966), provoking Arab hostility and complicating U.S. Cold War strategy in the Middle East. The CIA covertly funded an anti-Zionist lobby (AFME) to counterbalance pro-Israel influence.

**1967 War and Policy Shifts**  
Israel preemptively attacked Egypt on June 5, 1967, despite U.S. intelligence indicating no imminent Arab threat. The U.S. initially declared neutrality but reversed course under intense lobbying (AIPAC). Following the war, Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza, Sinai, and Golan Heights. The U.S. supported Israel’s territorial expansion, departing from its prior policy of supporting territorial integrity. The USS Liberty attack (June 8, 1967), resulting in 34 U.S. deaths, was covered up as a "mistake" despite evidence of deliberation.

**Nuclear Proliferation and Strategic Divergence**  
Israel pursued nuclear weapons covertly, stealing enriched uranium from the U.S. in the 1950s-60s. U.S. administrations consistently opposed nuclear proliferation in the region but failed to curb Israel’s program. Strategic analyses (e.g., 1953 National Intelligence Estimate) warned that U.S. ties to Israel destabilized the Middle East and harmed U.S. interests, while Israeli aggression fueled Soviet influence.

**Lobby Dominance and Policy Consequences**  
By the 1960s, AIPAC emerged as the Israel Lobby’s primary arm, bypassing Foreign Agents Registration Act rules. Lobbyists like Mike Feldman gained direct White House access. U.S. arms sales to Israel surged, despite opposition from State Department, military, and intelligence officials citing regional instability. The lobby successfully pressured administrations to prioritize Israeli interests over U.S. strategic needs, contributing to the 1973 Yom Kippur War and the rise of the PLO.

**Long-Term Implications**  
The U.S.-Israel "special relationship" became entrenched, with AIPAC influencing policy across administrations. Israeli intransigence on settlements, refugees, and nuclear non-proliferation persisted, undermining U.S. diplomatic efforts. Lobby-driven interventions (e.g., Iraq War, 2003) linked U.S. military action to Israeli security concerns, exacerbating anti-American sentiment globally.
