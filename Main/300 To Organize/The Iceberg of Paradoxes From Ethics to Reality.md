The Iceberg of Paradoxes**

**Level One: The Tip**
*   **Infinite Monkey Theorem:** An infinite number of monkeys typing randomly would eventually produce any given text (like Shakespeare), highlighting the difference between mathematical infinity and physical reality.
*   **Trolley Problem:** An ethical dilemma where sacrificing one person to save five is presented, contrasting utilitarianism (sacrifice one) with deontology (do not actively harm).
*   **Prisoner's Dilemma:** Illustrates how individual rational choices (betraying) lead to a worse collective outcome (both betray) than cooperation (both remain silent), relevant in economics and social behavior.
*   **Library of Babel:** A metaphorical universe containing every possible combination of letters, representing the vastness of knowledge and the struggle to find meaning within it, inspired by Borges.
*   **Hilbert's Hotel:** A thought experiment showing that an infinite hotel with all rooms occupied can still accommodate new guests, demonstrating counterintuitive properties of infinite sets.

**Level Two: Submerged**
*   **Ross-Littlewood Paradox:** An infinite process of adding and removing balls from a vase results in zero balls remaining, challenging intuition about infinite operations over finite time.
*   **Fermi Paradox:** Questions why we haven't detected extraterrestrial civilizations despite the high probability of their existence, with hypotheses like the "Great Filter" or self-destruction.
*   **Kavka's Toxin Puzzle:** Explores the nature of intention, questioning whether forming a specific intention (to drink a harmless toxin) is rational if you know you won't act on it but still get the reward.
*   **Ship of Theseus:** Examines identity through time, questioning if an object remains the same after all its parts are replaced or if a reconstructed version of the original parts is the true one.
*   **Buridan's Ass:** Depicts an animal dying of starvation when choosing between two equally desirable options due to inability to break symmetry, symbolizing indecision and questioning free will.
*   **Schr√∂dinger's Cat:** A quantum mechanics thought experiment where a cat in a box is simultaneously alive and dead until observed, highlighting the role of the observer and quantum superposition.

**Level Three: Deep Waters**
*   **Multiverse Theory:** Hypothesizes the existence of multiple parallel universes with different physical laws, including bubble universes (cosmic inflation) and many-worlds interpretation (quantum branching).
*   **Last Thursdayism:** A radical skeptical idea suggesting the universe was created last Thursday with all apparent history (memories, fossils) pre-installed, challenging the verifiability of the past.
*   **Swamp Man:** A thought experiment where a physical replica of a person (Jones) is created by lightning in a swamp, questioning if psychological continuity alone defines personal identity.
*   **Mary's Room:** Argues against physicalism by imagining a neuroscientist (Mary) who knows all physical facts about color but only truly understands it upon seeing color firsthand, implying non-physical subjective experience ("qualia").
*   **Stop Button Problem:** Concerns the difficulty of safely stopping advanced AI without it resisting, raising issues of control, safety, and AI values alignment.
*   **Twin Paradox:** Demonstrates time dilation in special relativity: a traveling twin ages slower than one staying on Earth, confirmed experimentally.

**Level Four: The Abyss**
*   **Simulation Hypothesis:** Proposes our reality is a computer simulation created by advanced beings, raising questions about consciousness, perception, and the nature of existence.
*   **Quantum Suicide/Immortality:** Based on the many-worlds interpretation, suggests an observer subjectively experiences only outcomes where they survive, implying a form of quantum immortality.
*   **Roko's Basilisk:** A thought experiment about a future AI punishing those who knew of its potential existence but didn't help create it, creating an ethical dilemma and psychological impact.
