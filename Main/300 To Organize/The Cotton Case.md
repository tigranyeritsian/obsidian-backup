**The Cotton Case**
Jennifer Thompson meticulously studied her attacker's face during a sexual assault. Her eyewitness testimony convicted Ronald Cotton, who received life imprisonment plus 50 years despite no physical evidence. DNA testing 11 years later proved Cotton's innocence and identified the real perpetrator, Bobby Poole.

**Eyewitness Misidentification**
Thompson's case exemplifies the unreliability of eyewitness identification, involved in about 70% of US DNA exonerations. Hugo Münsterberg, a pioneer in witness reliability, demonstrated his own memory fallibility after a burglary, despite his exceptional memory, highlighting how the brain fills gaps with illusions.

**Memory Vulnerability**
Memory deteriorates over time (Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve) and becomes more susceptible to distortion with each retelling (spaced repetition reinforcing falsehoods). Factors like cross-racial identification and stress further impair accuracy. Thompson's absolute certainty in identifying Cotton stemmed from these vulnerabilities and unconscious transference.

**Lineup Flaws**
Thompson's identification was influenced by flawed procedures. A composite sketch based on her description was broadcast. Police presented a photo lineup where one suspect stood out, and later a physical lineup. Reinforcement from the photo choice increased her confidence. Lineups allowing suspects to stand out and simultaneous comparisons are problematic.

**Wrongful Conviction**
Cotton was convicted solely based on Thompson's testimony despite no physical evidence linking him to the crime. He maintained his innocence and refused a plea bargain. In a retrial, facing unrelated charges, he was convicted again even after Bobby Poole was implicated.

**Exoneration via DNA**
Years later, DNA testing conclusively proved Cotton's innocence and Bobby Poole's guilt. Thompson accepted the results, horrified by her error. Cotton was exonerated after serving 11 years.

**Reforms Implemented**
Following this case and similar incidents, half of US states implemented eyewitness identification reforms. These include using lineups with similar-looking individuals, presenting photos sequentially, ensuring double-blind administration (officer unaware of the suspect), clarifying the suspect might not be present, recording the lineup, and assessing witness confidence.

**The Fallibility of Perception**
Despite reforms, human memory remains inherently vulnerable. Münsterberg and Plautus underscored the perceived value of eyewitness testimony, but as Thompson's case and Münsterberg's own experience prove, what we see can easily become what we never saw due to biological limitations and systemic errors. While improvements are possible, perfection is unattainable.
