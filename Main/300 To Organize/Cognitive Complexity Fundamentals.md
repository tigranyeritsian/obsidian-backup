Cognitive Complexity Fundamentals**
Every person possesses an emotional evaluation construct (like/dislike). Cognitive complexity describes how individuals perceive and process information, ranging from high to low.

**Cognitive Complexity and Perception**
High cognitive complexity involves perceiving the world as more diverse and differentiated. This often correlates with higher sensitivity and an ability to notice finer details.

**Cognitive Styles**
Two primary cognitive styles exist:
1.  **Global (Field-Dependent):** Difficulty distinguishing details; perceives objects as wholes. Struggles with tasks requiring finding differences or simple figures within complex configurations.
2.  **Differentiated (Field-Independent):** Easily distinguishes details and parts, including subtle ones. Analyzes objects effectively.

**Characteristics of High Cognitive Complexity**
Strongly associated with the differentiated style. Linked to:
*   Enhanced creative abilities (divergent thinking).
*   Greater capacity for empathy (distinguishing the person from one's own feelings and understanding others' thoughts/feelings).
*   Accessible understanding of one's own thoughts and feelings.

**Influences on Cognitive Complexity**
Cognitive complexity is often shaped by upbringing and profession. Examples:
*   **Agricultural Children (e.g., specific African group):** Lower complexity. Routine, stereotyped actions and potentially authoritarian parenting foster a global style.
*   **Children of Hunters (e.g., Eskimo group):** Higher complexity. Despite a seemingly uniform environment (snow), language shows nuanced differentiation. Parenting emphasizes early independence, fostering a differentiated style and higher complexity.
