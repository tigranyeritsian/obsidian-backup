Ceasefire Status**  
A ceasefire with limited humanitarian objectives began in Nagorno-Karabakh on October 10th at 12:00. Negotiations continue.

**Geographical Context**  
The conflict involves diverse terrain: mountains, forests, and plains. Initial fighting occurred on open plains near the foothills, but combat has predominantly shifted to mountainous, hilly, and forested areas. Understanding the landscape is crucial, as false assumptions about mountain warfare hindering advancement are inaccurate.

**Terrain Analysis**  
*   **Northern Front:** Mountainous/hilly terrain transitioning to forests, perpendicular ridges and valleys parallel to main roads. Open areas are interspersed but offer defensive advantages. Good defensive positions and ambush opportunities exist. Progress requires clearing ridges flanking the road.
*   **Western Front:** Dense forest with minimal roads and open areas, extending to the reservoir. Forces must choose between closed forests or semi-open hills.
*   **Southern Front:** Initially open, quickly transitioned to hills/mountains near Jabrail. Near the Iranian border, vegetation increases. Open terrain near Gorus transitions to forested mountains. Roads pass through both forests and open areas with cover suitable for anti-tank fire.
*   **Central Plains:** Relatively flat terrain (e.g., from the Terter River). Fighting was intense early on but has diminished. Artillery and drone strikes continue. This area requires complex coordination for breakthroughs.

**Tactical Observations on Mountain/L Warfare**  
Mountain/forest combat has unique challenges:
*   **Visibility:** Limited to 30-40% from any point, requiring multi-point observation for effective defense.
*   **Defensive Complexity:** Building a comprehensive defensive system is difficult due to dead zones.
*   **Advantages for Offense:** Attackers (like Azerbaijan) can use dead zones and vegetation for cover, advancing slowly but steadily. Infantry flanking maneuvers are essential to clear ridges and allow armored columns to advance.
*   **Urban Warfare:** Capturing ruined settlements (e.g., Agdam) requires house-to-house fighting, where Azerbaijan uses drones effectively.

**Azerbaijan's Strategy**  
*   **Northern/Southern Advance:** Focusing on mountain/hilly routes north and south, bypassing the central plains. This path is significantly longer but may be logistically simpler for Azerbaijan's current force structure.
*   **Infantry-Centric:** The burden of slow, deliberate mountain advance falls primarily on infantry, supported by drones and artillery, potentially reducing complex coordination demands compared to the central plains.
*   **Logistics:** Advancing through mountains requires meticulous clearance of ridges and valleys by infantry before armored vehicles can move along roads.
*   **Urban Targets:** Capturing settlements involves surrounding high ground first, then engaging the town itself to clear routes for armor.

**Conclusion on Mountain Warfare**  
While mountains and forests offer defensive advantages, they are not insurmountable. Azerbaijan's material superiority, combined with drone support and infantry tactics, allows for slow but steady progress in this terrain, challenging the notion that mountains solely benefit defenders. Success hinges on infantry capability and coordination.
