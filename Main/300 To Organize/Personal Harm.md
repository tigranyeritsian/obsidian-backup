Personal Harm**  
The author describes their own unhealthy upbringing in evangelical Christianity, feeling held back and harmed. However, they emphasize the most sinister aspect was being taught to proudly identify as a Zionist from childhood.

**The Sinister Core**  
Christian Zionism is identified as the most misunderstood and brushed-over yet highly influential aspect of evangelical Christianity, shaping both American Christianity and US foreign policy.

**Theology & Prophecy**  
Christian Zionism stems from dispensationalism, a 19th-century theology framing Israel's role as central to end-times prophecy (e.g., rebuilding the Temple, gathering Jews, the Rapture, Tribulation, and Christ's return). This involves biblical literalism, particularly of the Book of Revelation, which the author notes has interpretations added centuries later.

**Political Manifestation**  
This belief system transcends personal faith, manifesting in real-world politics. It drives billions in US military aid to Israel, pressures politicians to support Israel unconditionally (even against ceasefires), normalizes occupation and apartheid, and is used to justify violence against Palestinians.

**Broader Consequences**  
The impact extends beyond Palestinians to threaten democracy, diplomacy, and religious ethics. The author challenges progressive Christians to question adhering to a belief system used to justify such violence, arguing that even "innocent" faith can lead to severe immorality.

**Dominant Influence**  
Evangelical Christianity, promoted through mega-churches, televangelists, and the religious right, is a dominant cultural force in the US. Christian Zionism is a key part of this, intertwined with conservatism and used to sway political agendas, including unwavering support for Israel.
