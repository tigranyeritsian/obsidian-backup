1965 Casablanca Massacre**  
Thousands of students marched for educational rights in Casablanca on March 22-23, 1965. The regime responded with brutal force: troops opened fire, helicopters strafed crowds, snipers targeted civilians. Officially, 12 died; witnesses claimed nearly 1,000 were killed. Bodies remained uncollected for days. King Hassan II later blamed intellectuals, declaring, "there is no greater danger to the state than a so-called intellectual; it would have been better if you were all illiterate."

**Rise of Opposition and Repression**  
After independence in 1956, King Hassan II consolidated absolute power. Political opponents faced harassment, exile, or execution. Socialist leader Mehdi Ben Barka, a vocal critic, was sentenced to death in absentia in 1963 for opposing the monarchy and then disappeared in Paris in 1965, allegedly on General Mohammad Oufkir's orders. In 1965, Hassan II suspended civil liberties, ruling by decree for five years. Intellectuals, poets, and students were imprisoned and tortured. Marxist journal *Souffles*, founded in 1966, was banned in 1972; co-founder Abdelatif Laabi was tortured and imprisoned for a decade.

**Cold War Alliance and US Support**  
Hassan II aligned Morocco with the US and West during the Cold War, viewing socialist neighbors like Algeria as threats. Morocco's strategic location made it vital for US military bases. The US provided military aid, trained Moroccan intelligence (especially the DST), and offered diplomatic backing, viewing Hassan as a reliable partner against leftist and nationalist dissent. This support intensified after failed coup attempts in 1971 and 1972. Morocco also became a site for CIA black sites, like Tazmamart, where detainees were tortured and held in inhumane conditions, with CIA involvement confirmed.

**Control Through Education and Narrative**  
The monarchy reshaped history and thought through the education system. Textbooks were rewritten to glorify the monarchy and Arab-Islamic unity while erasing dissent, indigenous diversity, and critical events like the 1965 massacre. Sociology institutes were dissolved; philosophy and social sciences were curtailed or removed from curricula. Arabization policies aimed at reducing French influence also suppressed critical thinking, creating an elite class and marginalizing the masses. Literacy rates remained low (41.6% for adults in 1994), and the system prioritized loyalty over skills, stifling social mobility.

**Long-Term Consequences**  
Decades of repression, US-backed authoritarianism, and educational manipulation suppressed democratic aspirations, fostered collective amnesia, and entrenched inequality. The monarchy maintained a facade of stability ("at least the country is stable") while suppressing dissent. Today, the king retains ultimate control over business, politics, and media, making decisions like normalizing ties with Israel without public mandate, and protests remain ineffective. The "Years of Lead" legacy persists, with fragile rights and underlying dysfunction masked by enforced silence.
