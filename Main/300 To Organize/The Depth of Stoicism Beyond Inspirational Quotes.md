Stoicism's Origins**  
Stoicism originated in ancient Greece with Zeno of Citium, influenced by Socrates, Cynics, and other schools. It began at the Stoa Poikile (Painted Porch), giving the philosophy its name. Early writings are lost, but Chrysippus systematized the teachings into a comprehensive philosophy focused on human flourishing.

**Stoic Physics**  
Stoic physics is materialist (or corporalist), believing only bodies truly exist. Reality comprises active (God/Zeus/Logos) and passive principles, with Pneuma (breath) enabling properties. The universe is deterministic, cycling through order and conflagration (destruction/rebirth). Time and void "subsist" but don't exist. God is immanent, governing all events.

**Stoic Logic**  
Logic is broad, covering dialectic, epistemology, language, and rhetoric. The Stoic Sage is the ideal dialectician, possessing infallible knowledge based on understanding the causal structure of the world. Knowledge involves secure mental impressions (catalepsy) rooted in reality.

**Stoic Ethics**  
Ethics, the culmination of Stoicism, centers on living virtuously "according to nature." Humans are rational and social. Divine Providence ensures harmony, though human folly disrupts it. Virtue is the sole good, comprising prudence, justice, temperance, and courage. Pleasure, pain, wealth, and status are "preferred indifferents" â€“ neither good nor bad. The Sage is passionless (apatheia), acting rightly without emotional disturbance.

**Roman Stoics**  
Stoicism spread to Rome, gaining popularity among figures like Marcus Aurelius (emperor), Epictetus (formerly enslaved), Seneca (statesman), and Musonius Rufus (practical ethicist). Their works often emphasized ethics, shifting focus from earlier theoretical physics and logic.

**Modern Disconnect**  
Modern popularizations often reduce Stoicism to inspirational quotes or practical ethics (e.g., dichotomy of control), detached from its original physics and logic. Philosophers like Montaigne and Emerson extracted ethical elements, ignoring concepts like Pneuma or Divine Providence. This disconnect highlights a tension between Stoicism's ancient interconnected system and its modern fragmented application.

**The Core Tension**  
Stoicism's endurance lies in its adaptable ethics, while its complex physics and logic (e.g., materialism, determinism) are often abandoned. The ancient Stoics viewed philosophy as an integrated system where ethics depended on understanding the universe, yet modern users find value in ethics alone. This raises questions about the coherence of selectively applying Stoic principles.
