Early Influences**  
Jan Rustem (1761-1853), an Armenian-born professor in Vilnius, likely provided Shevchenko with foundational artistic advice ("draw for six years, paint for six months"). Rustem's democratic views and social criticism shaped Shevchenko's early worldview.

**Academic Connections**  
At the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts, Shevchenko befriended Armenian peers:  
- Stepan Nersesov (Nersisyan, 1815-1884), a prominent portraitist.  
- Movses Melikov (1818-?), who later documented the Academy atmosphere and praised teacher Karl Bryullov's support for emerging talents, including Shevchenko.

**Aivazovsky Relationship**  
Ivan (Ovanes) Aivazovsky (1817-1900) briefly cohabitated with Shevchenko in 1840. Though initially unimpressed, Shevchenko later admired Aivazovsky's landscapes but criticized his commercial genre paintings, accusing him of sacrificing artistic integrity for profit despite philanthropic efforts.

**Intellectual Bonds**  
Shevchenko shared ideological kinship with Armenian poet Mikael Nalbandyan (1829-1866), both fighting for national freedom. Nalbandyan revered Shevchenko as a "prophet of freedom" and referenced his works, though direct contact remains unconfirmed.

**Local Interactions**  
During exile in Mangyshlak (1850-1857), Shevchenko engaged with Armenian communities:  
- Visited Armenian settlements, showing particular interest in their marginalized lives.  
- Held extensive conversations with Armenian priests in Mangyshlak and Astrakhan, observing their customs and struggles.  
- Documented Astrakhan's Armenian community in his diary and depicted their social realities in the novella "Bliznetsy" (The Twins).
