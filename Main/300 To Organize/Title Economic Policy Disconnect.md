Title**: Economic Policy Disconnect

**Tags**: Modern Monetary Theory, Phillips Curve, NAIRU, Deficit Reduction, Inflation, Political Economy

**Economists' Beliefs**
*   Focus on the Phillips Curve and NAIRU concepts historically shaped policy.
*   Belief in a fixed unemployment threshold (e.g., 6%) below which inflation rises.
*   Debate during the Clinton expansion challenged this, suggesting NAIRU could fall (e.g., to 4%) without inflation due to productivity gains.

**Failed Deficit Reduction Rationale**
*   Debt ceiling drama (Summer 2011) framed US as potentially becoming Greece, forcing deficit cuts.
*   Post-compromise reality contradicted fears: interest rates fell, US credit rating downgraded, but no default or spike in borrowing costs.
*   Analogy: Like fighting the Battle of New Orleans *after* the war ended; the reason for austerity (imminent default/high rates) vanished.

**Inflation Concerns Overstated**
*   Deficits are not the cause of inflation; overspending could be.
*   Central banks (Japan, Fed) have struggled to generate inflation despite efforts.
*   No credible inflation forecasts exist; Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) predict very low inflation.
*   Burden of proof lies on proponents of cuts to show inflation risk, yet cuts proceed despite lack of evidence.

**Political Process Failure**
*   Politicians (even those who understand the economics) remain trapped by deficit reduction propaganda.
*   Fear of being seen as "pro-deficit" leads to acceptance of unnecessary cuts (e.g., Social Security, Medicare).
*   Public perception, driven by past narratives, forces politicians to fight a "war" that is already over.

**Taxes as Thermostat, Not Revenue Tool**
*   Government size is a political decision (teachers, soldiers, judges).
*   Once size is set, taxes act as a thermostat for the *existing* government size relative to economic conditions (full employment).
*   Deficits are residual; appropriate deficit size is measured by unemployment, not by fear of default or repayment.

**Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) Insight**
*   The primary barrier to prosperity and full employment is ideological misunderstanding.
*   No real resource shortages exist; the issue is political will and acceptance of functional monetary operations.
*   Academic understanding is growing, but political adoption remains slow.
