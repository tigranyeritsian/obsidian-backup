Private Equity Leverage Layers**  
Traditional private equity uses debt at the company level to maximize equity, enabling acquisitions of larger assets. However, rising interest rates and difficult exits have spurred two additional leverage layers: net asset value (NAV) financing at the fund level to pay investors when exits stall, and management company loans (Manco loans) at the top level to fund new investments. This three-tiered structure relies on underlying asset performance; if companies falter, debt servicing fails at each layer, risking systemic collapse. NAV financing carries double-digit interest rates, signaling heightened risk, while Manco loans are secured against fund returns, amplifying vulnerabilities.  

**FTC Antitrust Actions**  
Under Chair Linda Khan, the FTC is aggressively pursuing antitrust cases against major corporations. The Microsoft-Activision and Amgen-Horizon deals were blocked over potential monopolies but overturned in court, highlighting Khanâ€™s challenges. Amazon now faces a comprehensive FTC complaint targeting its e-commerce model, accused of anti-competitive practices like favoring its own products. Despite losses in prior cases, concessions and regulatory precedent are emerging. Khan faces political pressure and industry resistance, with her role potentially contingent on the 2024 U.S. election.
