Kahane's Origins and Ideology**  
Meir Kahane founded the Jewish Defense League (JDL) in 1968, advocating violent protection of Jews and expelling Palestinians from Israel. His ideology, Kahanism, demands a theocratic Jewish state governed by religious law, banning Arab-Jewish relations and stripping Palestinians of rights. Kahane explicitly rejected democracy as incompatible with Zionism.

**Historical Roots in Zionism**  
Kahanism emerged from revisionist Zionism, which favored fascist tactics and rejected territorial compromises. Groups like the Irgun and Stern Gang pioneered violent colonization, aligning with figures like Jabotinsky and Ben-Gurion, who also sought Israeli control over Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Sinai. The Haganah later integrated these forces into the IDF.

**Kahane's Vision and Tactics**  
Kahane advocated forced expulsion ("They Must Go") or subjugation of Palestinians as "fifth columnists." He promoted messianic fervor, biblical borders encompassing Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq, and endorsed settler violence against Palestinian villages, olive groves, and religious sites.

**Goldstein and Hebron Massacre**  
Kahane's follower Baruch Goldstein (formerly Carl Benjamin) massacred 29 Palestinian worshippers in Hebron's Ibrahimi Mosque in 1994. The Kach party was subsequently banned, but its influence persisted.

**Current Political Influence**  
Kahanism thrives within Israel's government, exemplified by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a former Kach member who reveres Kahane and Goldstein. Settler groups like the Hilltop Youth, livestreaming attacks on Palestinians, operationalize Kahanist ethnic cleansing parallel to the Gaza genocide.

**Zionist Complicity**  
Left-wing and right-wing Zionism collaborate in colonization: right-wing extremists enact violence ("shock troops"), while liberals provide a "human face," normalizing displacement. Both factions deny Palestinian claims to land like Haifa and Jaffa.

**Zionism's Contradiction**  
Kahane exposed Zionism's core conflict: it cannot be both democratic and Jewish. He demanded expulsion as the solution, contrasting with liberal Zionists' failed attempts at reconciliation.
