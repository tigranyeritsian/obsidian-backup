Failed War Plans of 1914**
The initial campaigns of WWI saw catastrophic failures for all major belligerents except Britain. Germany failed to seize Paris, France could not break through in Alsace-Lorraine, Austria was repelled from Serbia, and Russia suffered heavy defeats in East Prussia. Britain's deployment of the BEF to France was logistically successful but strategically disastrous, committing the Empire to years of costly land warfare on German terms.

**Fisher's Alternative: The Baltic Plan**
Britain, as the dominant naval power, had a fundamentally different strategic option proposed by First Sea Lord Jackie Fisher and naval historian Julian Corbett. Drawing inspiration from Pitt the Elder's strategy against France, they advocated using British naval supremacy to win via economic warfare â€“ strangling Germany through a complete naval blockade.

**The Baltic Imperative**
For this blockade to be swift and decisive, it required closing the Baltic Sea to Germany. Open Baltic access allowed vital trade with Sweden, sustaining the German war economy. Fisher argued the Baltic had to be breached to force the German High Seas Fleet into battle and cut off this trade lifeline.

**Devising the Baltic Strategy**
The plan involved tricking Germany into preemptively invading Denmark to secure the Danish Straits (Great Belt and Sound). While the Grand Fleet held the North Sea, a new specialized "Baltic Fleet" would be constructed. This fleet, consisting of shallow-draft monitors, light battlecruisers, modified cruisers, submarines, and minesweepers, would enter the Baltic, blockade German trade, and avoid risky North Sea engagements.

**Conflict and Churchill's Opposition**
Fisher kept his detailed plans confidential, hindering consensus. The Army and figures like Henry Wilson prioritized deploying the BEF to France alongside French forces. When recalled in 1914, Fisher planned to first regain the Belgian Coast with the BEF and his monitors, then unleash the Baltic Fleet in 1916. This clashed with Churchill (First Lord of the Admiralty), who favored quicker, purely naval victories like the Dardanelles and doubted the need to wait for the Baltic Fleet.

**Fisher's Resignation and the Dardanelles**
Churchill blocked Fisher's Baltic cruiser construction and sidelined his Baltic memo. Frustrated, Fisher walked out in January 1915, returning under pressure but finding his plans suppressed to maintain cabinet cohesion. Churchill's failed Dardanelles campaign, violating Fisher's principle of combined arms operations, shattered their relationship. Fisher resigned in April 1915 after submarines destined for the Baltic were diverted to Gallipoli.

**Historical Significance**
Fisher's Baltic Plan represented a potentially war-winning British maritime strategy, avoiding costly land warfare. However, Fisher's secrecy and arrogance, combined with Churchill's impatience and the Army's continental focus, prevented its serious consideration. This decision locked Britain into a devastating land war, conscription, and economic catastrophe.
