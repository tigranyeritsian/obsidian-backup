# Turkey's Economic Crisis: Inflation, Interest Rates, and Currency Challenges

**Inflation Situation**
Turkey's inflation decreased from over 75% last year to 35% in May 2025. While this represents half of last year's rate, 35% remains extremely high by global standards. Turkey has the second-highest inflation rate in the G20, only behind Argentina (43.5%), with most other G20 countries having inflation rates below 5%. Globally, Turkey ranks among the top 10 countries with the highest inflation rates.

**Interest Rates**
Turkish interest rates peaked at 50% in 2024 and were recently increased back to 46%. These high rates aim to discourage borrowing and spending but negatively impact GDP growth by discouraging investment and consumption. Turkey has the highest interest rates in the G20, even higher than Argentina, and globally ranks second only to Venezuela in terms of interest rate levels.

**Food Inflation**
Food inflation in Turkey decreased from 70% to 33% year-over-year. At 33% food inflation, people need approximately a 50% pay raise just to maintain their standard of living. Turkey has the second-highest food inflation in the G20, behind Argentina, and globally ranks among the top 10 countries for food inflation rates.

**Currency Value**
The Turkish lira has significantly depreciated, from around 33 lira per USD last year to around 40 lira per USD currently. Over the past five years, the lira has collapsed from around 4 lira per USD to 40 lira per USD. This has led to widespread "dollarization" as people prefer holding foreign currencies, diminishing the central bank's monetary policy effectiveness.

**Producer Prices**
Producer prices in Turkey decreased from over 50% growth to 23% year-over-year. Despite this improvement, 23% producer price inflation remains very high. Turkey has the highest producer price inflation in the G20, followed by Argentina at 22%, while many G20 countries are actually experiencing deflation in producer prices.

**Economic Challenges**
Turkey, as a net importer, needs to grow its GDP to pay for essential imports. High inflation, producer prices, and interest rates make it difficult for Turkish businesses to compete internationally. The economic situation causes severe hardship for ordinary citizens, and the central bank faces a difficult balancing act between controlling inflation and stimulating economic growth.
