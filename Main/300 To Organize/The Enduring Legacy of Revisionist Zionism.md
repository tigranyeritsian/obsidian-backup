Jabotinsky's Iron Wall Doctrine**
Vladimir Jabotinsky published "The Iron Wall" in 1923, advocating for the colonization of Palestine through force, recognizing Palestinian resistance as inevitable and insurmountable except by military means. He dismissed European efforts to end anti-Semitism as futile and envisioned a Jewish state modeled on European colonial dominance.

**Fascist Ideology and Alliances**
Jabotinsky explicitly drew parallels between Revisionist Zionism and Italian Fascism, adopting its symbols, paramilitary structure (Betar), and militaristic ideals. Mussolini reciprocated, seeing a fascist Zionist ally against British power, allowing the Betar naval academy in Italy. This collaboration ended in 1938 due to Italy's racial laws.

**Paramilitary Violence and State Terrorism**
The Revisionist movement's military wings, Irgun and Lehi, employed terrorism against British authorities and Palestinian civilians after 1939, including bombings, assassinations, and attacks targeting infrastructure and public spaces. Lehi assassinated UN mediator Count Folke Bernadotte in 1948 for proposing Palestinian refugee rights and territorial limits.

**Enduring Political Legacy**
The ideology shaped Israel's political landscape, with Revisionist leaders becoming Prime Ministers (Begin, Shamir, Sharon). Benjamin Netanyahu embodies this legacy, rejecting Palestinian rights, embracing permanent military domination, and opposing negotiations, embodying the permanent "Iron Wall."

**Failure of the Iron Wall Strategy**
Despite repeated efforts to eliminate Palestinian leadership and crush resistance, the strategy failed. The continuous supply of resilient Palestinian resistance demonstrates the "Iron Wall's" fundamental flaw: it cannot produce a compliant population.
