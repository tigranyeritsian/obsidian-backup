Global Management Doctrine**  
Victor Yefimov outlines humanity's 4,000-year "slave civilization" paradigm, advocating for a new development model rooted in conceptual power. He critiques liberal-bourgeois systems as unsustainable, positioning Russia as the "holding force" preserving spiritual foundations against global collapse threats.  

**Human Superiority Over AI**  
Yefimov asserts humans possess innate divine connection (algorithmic spirituality) granting free will, conscience, and intuition—qualities absent in artificial intelligence. AI remains programmable and non-competitive, with human-machine comparisons dismissed as "folly."  

**Historical Figures & Power**  
Reflecting on Putin, Gorbachev, Yeltsin, and Zhirinovsky, he emphasizes Putin's conceptual authority and moral grounding. Yeltsin and Zhirinovsky are criticized as program-driven figures lacking deeper understanding, while Gorbachev symbolizes catastrophic mismanagement.  

**Spiritual & Existential Truths**  
Death is deemed illusory; the soul ("fragment of non-manifest reality") reincarnates based on earthly deeds. Alcohol and tobacco are tools of control, not personal choices. True spirituality resides in life alignment with cosmic principles, not ritual. Pushin is hailed as a prophet encoding hidden wisdom in language.  

**Educational Revolution**  
His "School of Management" teaches sovereign governance principles: self-mastery, purpose-setting, structural implementation, and control. He calls for societal transformation through universal management literacy, replacing fragmented expertise with holistic "life-language" skills.  

**Russia's Global Role**  
Russia holds a sacred mission to dismantle liberal-bourgeois systems and restore multipolarity. Putin’s leadership is pivotal, though tactical alliances (e.g., Trump) may serve short-term goals. The SMO represents a planetary cleansing operation beyond mere geopolitics.
