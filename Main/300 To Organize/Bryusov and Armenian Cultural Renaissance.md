Bryusov's Advocacy Role**  
Valery Bryusov became a pivotal advocate for Armenian literature and culture, especially after the 1915 Genocide. He promoted Armenian poetry to Russian audiences, emphasizing its uniqueness and historical significance.

**The "Poetry of Armenia" Anthology**  
In 1915, Bryusov agreed to edit a Russian-language anthology of Armenian poetry, "Poetry of Armenia from Ancient Times to Our Days," after encouragement from Maxim Gorky and the Moscow Armenian Committee. He personally translated half the poems and wrote a foundational introduction.

**Scholarly Analysis of Armenian Literature**  
Bryusov conducted the first comprehensive Russian analysis of Armenian poetry, linking its development to the 5th-century alphabet. He highlighted diverse influences (Iranian, Greek, etc.) while stressing its role as a mirror of the Armenian soul. His research remains scientifically valuable.

**Creative Works Inspired by Armenia**  
His engagement led to a cycle of poems celebrating Armenia's history and resilience. Key works include "To Armenia," "To the Armenians," "Tigran the Great," and "Victory at Carrhae," reflecting historical themes and national spirit.

**Personal Connections and Lectures**  
Bryusov forged relationships with Armenian poets (e.g., Hovhannes Tumanyan, Avetik Isahakyan) and delivered impactful lectures across Russia and the Caucasus (1916-1917), celebrating Armenian culture during a time of crisis.

**Legacy and Cultural Impact**  
Bryusov's work preserved and amplified Armenian literary heritage globally. His anthology and writings countered cultural erasure post-genocide, fostering cross-cultural understanding and affirming Armenian artistic achievement.
