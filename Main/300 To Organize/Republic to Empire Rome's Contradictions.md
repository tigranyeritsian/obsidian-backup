Republic's Founding Principles**  
After expelling the Tarquin dynasty, Romans swore never to accept a king, concluding monarchy itself was fundamentally corrupting and absolute power inherently flawed.  

**Plebeian Discontent and Secession**  
The plebeians, discontent with limited political opportunity and patrician exploitation, employed secession—a mass general strike—refusing labor and military service. Patricians realized Rome's dependence on the plebs and sought reconciliation.  

**Agrippa's Fable and Concessions**  
Senator Menenius Agrippa used the fable of the belly to argue the Senate's role was to receive and distribute resources for the people's benefit. Though Plutarch credited the fable, the establishment of the tribunate immediately after secession indicates material concessions were key to plebeian return.  

**Imperial Expansion's Impact**  
Foreign conquests (Italian communities, then the Mediterranean) created external wealth, pacifying class conflict by distributing spoils and fostering unity through patriotism. This also established a permanent underclass of non-citients and provincials, stripping plebs of radicalism through social hierarchy.  

**Constitutional Strain**  
Rome's governing norms, designed for a small city-state, became inadequate for empire. The creation of the provincial governorship (proconsul, propraetor) granted extraordinary, unaccountable power outside the constitution, contradicting Republican anti-monarchical principles.  

**Erosion of the Republic**  
Competition for lucrative provincial posts intensified factional conflict, bribery, and violence. Extended commands (e.g., Caesar's governorships) turned provinces into personal fiefdoms. Civil War (49 BCE) revealed troops loyal to commanders over the Republic.  

**Imperial Logic and Modern Parallels**  
Republicanism yielded to imperial prerogative, prioritizing exploitation and prosperity over liberty. Modern parallels include domestic surveillance and militarization stemming from imperial tactics. The "boomerang effect" shows how imperial control methods return home.  

**Conclusion: Solidarity Imperative**  
Like Rome, modern societies must reject exploiting others, recognizing that true freedom requires universal solidarity and rejecting the logic that entitles some to others' labor or wealth.
