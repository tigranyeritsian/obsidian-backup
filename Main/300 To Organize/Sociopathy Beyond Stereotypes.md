Understanding Sociopathy**  
Patrick Agney, a clinical psychologist with antisocial personality disorder, challenges the stereotype of sociopaths as one-dimensional serial killers. He explains that sociopathy involves difficulty learning "learned social emotions" like empathy and remorse, stemming from impaired emotional development rather than inherent evil.  

**Masking and Survival**  
Sociopaths mask emotions similarly to neurotypical people to navigate society, not solely for manipulation. Agney describes masking as exhausting but necessary for survival, enabling him to function professionally and maintain relationships.  

**Childhood and Destructive Urges**  
As a child, Agney experienced intense emotional pressure that he neutralized through destructive acts, such as stabbing a classmate. These acts provided euphoric relief from internal "pressure," not malice. He also engaged in non-violent compulsions like breaking into homes to achieve emotional apathy.  

**Diagnosis and Treatment**  
Diagnosed via the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R), Agney clarifies that sociopathy/psychopathy differs from antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) in DSM criteria. He advocates for therapy targeting coping mechanisms (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) rather than just suppressing behavior.  

**Relationships and Family Life**  
Agney notes relationships require mutual understanding of differing emotional experiences. His husband initially took his low affect personally but later accepted it as part of his neurology. As a parent, he avoids guilt-tripping, allowing his children to process emotions independently.  

**Advocacy and Representation**  
Agney argues that fictional portrayals (e.g., *Wednesday Addams*, *Dexter*) humanize sociopathy better than stereotypes. He urges reclassifying the disorder as "low affect disorder" to reduce stigma and calls for earlier intervention by asking, "What does feeling feel like?" to identify struggling children.
