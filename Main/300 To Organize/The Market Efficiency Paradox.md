Buffett's Contrarian Bet**  
Warren Buffett wagered that a passive index fund strategy would outperform active hedge funds over a decade. By 2017, he won decisively, with index funds consistently beating Wall Street professionals. This raises the question: How does "doing nothing" outsmart sophisticated traders?

**Market Makers and Price Discovery**  
During the 2017 crypto bubble, the author accidentally discovered how isolated exchanges lack liquidity. By posting limit orders on an empty exchange, they manipulated prices, highlighting how market makers ensure fair pricing through competition. Their presence minimizes "slippage," allowing large trades to execute closer to expected prices—similar to solutions for block orders in the 1980s stock market.

**Arbitrage as Market Correction**  
The author built a crypto arbitrage bot to exploit price discrepancies across exchanges. Automated "market makers" quickly competed to eliminate these gaps, proving that arbitrageurs like bees—connecting isolated markets and ensuring rapid information flow—stabilize prices. This mirrors global financial systems where traders push prices toward mathematically fair values.

**Short-Term Traders as Information Injectors**  
Traders like Paul Tudor Jones inject real-time data into markets by reacting instantly to news (e.g., OPEC decisions). Others profit from prediction markets (e.g., betting on obscure papal candidates), rewarding research in information-scarce environments. Their constant activity reflects reality, making markets efficient.

**Computerized Arbitrage and Pattern Recognition**  
Modern algorithms detect statistical relationships (e.g., Coke vs. Pepsi or bank stocks), creating "fuzzy corridors" where prices should reside. Trades correct deviations, spreading information across correlated assets. Firms like Renaissance Technologies use machine learning to find imperceptible patterns, acting as super-efficient information messengers.

**Index Funds and Collective Wisdom**  
William Sharpe's insight: All investors collectively form the "market portfolio." Index funds (e.g., S&P 500) own this portfolio passively, capturing the average performance of all traders' wisdom without fees. Since active traders incur costs and risk errors, index funds gradually outperform over time. Buffett's bet succeeds because passive investing avoids the "marathon" of active trading.

**The Power of Passive Investing**  
Since 1976, index funds have beaten ~90% of active funds. Owning the entire market means every trader works for your portfolio, updating it automatically as new information is incorporated. The secret to winning finance is refusing to play the active game—$10,000 invested in the S&P 500 in 1942 would now be worth $51 million.
