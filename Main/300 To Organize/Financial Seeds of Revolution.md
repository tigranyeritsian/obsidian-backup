Financial Collapse of the Monarchy**
France's monarchy faced bankruptcy due to crippling war debts, especially from supporting the American Revolution. Debt servicing consumed over half the royal income. The state could no longer borrow affordably or pay suppliers and soldiers.

**Archaic Tax System**
The financial system was archaic and corrupt. Taxes were collected by private "tax farmers" who exploited the population. Nobility and clergy were exempt from direct taxes, shifting the entire burden onto the Third Estate (commoners), who paid land tax, salt tax, tithes, and feudal dues. Bread constituted up to 70% of workers' expenses.

**Reform Failures**
Efforts by ministers like Turgot and Necker to reform the tax system and increase transparency failed due to fierce resistance from privileged classes refusing to surrender their exemptions. The monarchy lacked the will to compel change, leading to a loss of credibility and access to credit.

**Revolution's Financial Roots**
The storming of the Bastille in July 1789 was driven by economic desperation: debt, inflation, and skyrocketing bread prices caused by harvest failures, not just ideology. The Third Estate realized the crisis stemmed from a system designed to keep them poor while the privileged elite prospered.

**Assignats and Inflation**
The revolutionary government issued assignats, paper money backed by confiscated church lands, to solve the debt crisis. Initially popular, excessive printing led to hyperinflation. By 1795, assignats were worthless, destroying savings and purchasing power. Counterfeiting by enemies worsened the collapse.

**Social Consequences**
Inflation wiped out wages and savings, causing widespread hunger and social unrest. Price controls failed, leading to black markets and hoarding. Economic hardship fueled political paranoia and the Reign of Terror, where individuals were executed for economic "crimes" like hoarding grain.

**Modern Parallels**
The financial mistakes of the French Revolution – reckless borrowing, unfair taxation, and hyperinflation from printing money – echo in modern economies like Greece's debt crisis, US debt ceiling debates, and central bank liquidity injections. Inflation has returned, harming savers and workers. Financial systems often protect elites first.
