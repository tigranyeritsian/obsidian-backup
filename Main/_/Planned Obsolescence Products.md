### **1. Electronics and Technology**

**Smartphones**

- Batteries glued or soldered inside, making replacement nearly impossible.
    
- Software updates that make older models slower or incompatible with new apps.
    
- Proprietary chargers and ports (forcing upgrades when standards change).
    
- Limited spare part availability after only a few years.
    

**Laptops and Tablets**

- RAM, SSDs, and batteries soldered to the board.
    
- Thin cases that overheat easily and shorten component life.
    
- Discontinued support for drivers or operating systems.
    

**Printers**

- “End-of-life” chips that disable the printer after a fixed number of pages.
    
- Sensors that falsely detect low ink.
    
- Expensive cartridges that make repair less cost-effective than replacement.
    

**Headphones and Earbuds**

- Non-replaceable batteries in wireless models.
    
- Fragile cables that fray easily, no modular repair option.
    

**TVs and Monitors**

- Power boards with weak capacitors that fail after a few years.
    
- Smart TVs that stop receiving updates and lose app functionality.

### **2. Home Appliances**

**Washing Machines & Dishwashers**

- Sealed drums that prevent bearing replacement.
    
- Electronic boards sensitive to moisture and voltage surges.
    
- Short motor lifespans designed for a fixed number of cycles.
    

**Refrigerators**

- Compressors and seals designed for limited durability.
    
- Sensors and control boards failing earlier than mechanical parts.
    

**Vacuum Cleaners**

- Plastic parts that crack or deform.
    
- Proprietary filters or bags that become discontinued.
    

**Coffee Machines**

- Capsule counters that disable the machine after a certain number of uses.
    
- Non-repairable water pumps or heating elements.

### **3. Fashion and Consumer Goods**

**Clothing**

- Cheap fabrics and dyes that fade, tear, or lose shape quickly.
    
- Stitching designed to fail under moderate wear.
    

**Footwear**

- Glued soles that prevent repair or replacement.
    
- Thin synthetic materials instead of durable leather.
    

**Accessories**

- Jewelry with coatings that tarnish quickly.
    
- Watches with sealed batteries or non-repairable cases.

### **4. Automobiles**

- Plastic engine components that degrade from heat.
    
- Software locks that prevent third-party repairs (“right-to-repair” issue).
    
- Proprietary diagnostic tools available only to official service centers.
    
- Frequent redesigns making parts incompatible between model years.

### **5. Software and Digital Products**

- Operating systems ending support (forcing hardware upgrades).
    
- File formats that become obsolete (older software can’t open new files).
    
- Cloud services discontinuing old app versions.
    
- Smart devices that stop functioning once servers are shut down.

### **6. Everyday and Niche Products**

**Light Bulbs**

- Modern incandescent bulbs historically designed to burn out faster (the _Phoebus cartel_ case).
    
- Some LED bulbs use low-quality drivers that fail long before the diode itself.
    

**Toys and Gadgets**

- Plastic joints or battery covers designed to snap easily.
    
- Limited spare parts and discontinued batteries.
    

**Kitchen Tools**

- Non-replaceable blades in blenders or food processors.
    
- Short-life plastic gears in mixers.

### **7. Vehicles and Tools**

- **Power tools:** batteries incompatible across new generations.
    
- **Electric cars:** limited battery warranties, high replacement cost.
    
- **Navigation systems:** paid map updates; new models come with “free lifetime maps,” making old ones seem useless.
