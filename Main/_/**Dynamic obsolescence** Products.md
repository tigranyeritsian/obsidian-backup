**Dynamic obsolescence** (also called **technological** or **functional obsolescence**) happens when a product becomes outdated **not because it breaks**, but because **newer models or technologies** make it less useful or compatible — even though the old product still works.

It’s common in fast-changing industries where innovation, connectivity, or software drive value.

### **Examples of Products with Dynamic Obsolescence**

#### **1. Smartphones and Tablets**

- Older devices lose compatibility with new operating systems or apps.
    
- 4G/5G transitions make older network chips obsolete.
    
- New camera or AI features make older phones feel “slow” or “incomplete.”
    

#### **2. Computers and Laptops**

- Outdated processors or RAM can’t run modern software efficiently.
    
- New versions of Windows/macOS drop support for older hardware.
    
- USB, HDMI, and charging standards change, making ports incompatible.
    

#### **3. Smart TVs and Streaming Devices**

- Old TVs lose access to Netflix, YouTube, or other apps when support ends.
    
- New models include HDR or AI upscaling — older ones lack these features.
    

#### **4. Cars and Electric Vehicles**

- Older models lack connectivity (Apple CarPlay, over-the-air updates).
    
- New safety or battery systems make older models less desirable.
    
- Navigation systems become outdated when maps stop updating.
    

#### **5. Game Consoles**

- New generations introduce better graphics and exclusive games.
    
- Online services for old consoles (like PlayStation Network or Xbox Live) shut down.
    

#### **6. Smart Home Devices**

- Devices stop working when manufacturer servers go offline.
    
- Old versions can’t connect with updated ecosystems (e.g., Matter, HomeKit).
    

#### **7. Software and Apps**

- New file formats or frameworks make old versions incompatible.
    
- Web browsers and design tools drop plugin support.
    
- Companies move to subscription models, deactivating perpetual licenses.
    

#### **8. Cameras and Photography Equipment**

- New sensor technologies and AI features make old models less competitive.
    
- Memory cards, lenses, or batteries phased out for newer standards.

### **How It Differs from Planned Obsolescence**

|Aspect|Planned Obsolescence|Dynamic Obsolescence|
|---|---|---|
|**Cause**|Deliberate design for shorter lifespan|Natural result of technological progress|
|**Focus**|Physical wear or design limits|Functional or technological incompatibility|
|**Example**|Non-replaceable battery|Software no longer supported|
