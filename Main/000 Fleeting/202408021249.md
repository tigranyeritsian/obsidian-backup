Don't use dead phrases, start selecting words consciously
Small surface lexicon, effortless articulacy is limited to the size of your surface lexicon, read books, expand lexicon, use of ordinary words can still make you articulate
Poor thought retention, the longer you can engage a thought the greater the depth you can achieve with words

The quality of your speech is the product of your language environments.
Read books, poetry
